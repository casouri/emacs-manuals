<h3 class="section" id="Subdirectory-Switches-in-Dired"><span>30.12 Subdirectory Switches in Dired<a class="copiable-link" href="#Subdirectory-Switches-in-Dired"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>You can insert subdirectories with specified <code class="command">ls</code> switches in
Dired buffers using <kbd class="kbd">C-u i</kbd>.  You can change the <code class="command">ls</code>
switches of an already inserted subdirectory at point using <kbd class="kbd">C-u l</kbd>.
</p>
<p>Dired preserves the switches if you revert the buffer.  Deleting a
subdirectory forgets about its switches.
</p>
<p>Using <code class="code">dired-undo</code>
(see <a class="pxref" href="Marks-vs-Flags.html">Dired Marks vs. Flags</a>)
to reinsert or delete
subdirectories that were inserted with explicit switches can bypass
Dired&rsquo;s machinery for remembering (or forgetting) switches.  Deleting
a subdirectory using <code class="code">dired-undo</code> does not forget its switches.
When later reinserted using <kbd class="kbd">i</kbd>, it will be reinserted using its
old switches.  Using <code class="code">dired-undo</code> to reinsert a subdirectory that
was deleted using the regular Dired commands (not <code class="code">dired-undo</code>)
will originally insert it with its old switches.  Reverting the
buffer, however, will relist it using the buffer&rsquo;s default switches.
If any of this yields problems, you can easily correct the situation
using <kbd class="kbd">C-u i</kbd> or <kbd class="kbd">C-u l</kbd>.
</p>
<p>Dired does not remember the <code class="code">R</code> switch.  Inserting a subdirectory
with switches that include the <code class="code">R</code> switch is equivalent to
inserting each of its subdirectories using all remaining switches.
For instance, updating or killing a subdirectory that was inserted
with the <code class="code">R</code> switch will not update or kill its subdirectories.
</p>
<p>The buffer&rsquo;s default switches do not affect subdirectories that were
inserted using explicitly specified switches.  In particular,
commands such as <kbd class="kbd">s</kbd> that change the buffer&rsquo;s switches do not
affect such subdirectories.  (They do, however, affect subdirectories
without explicitly assigned switches.)
</p>
<p>You can make Dired forget about all subdirectory switches and relist
all subdirectories with the buffer&rsquo;s default switches using
<kbd class="kbd">M-x dired-reset-subdir-switches</kbd>.  This also reverts the Dired buffer.
