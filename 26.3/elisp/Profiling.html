<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-profile"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-performance-analysis"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-measuring-resource-usage"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-memory-usage"></a>

<p>If your program is working correctly, but not fast enough, and you
want to make it run more quickly or efficiently, the first thing to do
is <em class="dfn">profile</em> your code so that you know where it spends most of
the execution time.  If you find that one particular function is
responsible for a significant portion of the execution time, you can
start looking for ways to optimize that piece.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-profiler_002dstart"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-profiler_002dreport"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-profiler_002dstop"></a>
<p>Emacs has built-in support for this.  To begin profiling, type
<kbd class="kbd">M-x profiler-start</kbd>.  You can choose to profile by processor
usage, memory usage, or both.  Then run the code you&rsquo;d like to speed
up.  After that, type <kbd class="kbd">M-x profiler-report</kbd> to display a summary
buffer for each resource (cpu and memory) that you chose to profile.
The names of the report buffers include the times at which the reports
were generated, so you can generate another report later on without
erasing previous results.  When you have finished profiling, type
<kbd class="kbd">M-x profiler-stop</kbd> (there is a small overhead associated with
profiling, so we don&rsquo;t recommend leaving it active except when you are
actually running the code you want to examine).
</p>
<p>The profiler report buffer shows, on each line, a function that was
called, followed by how much resources (cpu or memory) it used in
absolute and percentage terms since profiling started.  If a given
line has a &lsquo;<samp class="samp">+</samp>&rsquo; symbol at the left-hand side, you can expand that
line by typing <kbd class="kbd"><kbd class="key">RET</kbd></kbd>, in order to see the function(s) called
by the higher-level function.  Use a prefix argument (<kbd class="kbd">C-u
<kbd class="key">RET</kbd></kbd>) to see the whole call tree below a function.  Pressing
<kbd class="kbd"><kbd class="key">RET</kbd></kbd> again will collapse back to the original state.
</p>
<p>Press <kbd class="kbd">j</kbd> or <kbd class="kbd">mouse-2</kbd> to jump to the definition of a function
at point.  Press <kbd class="kbd">d</kbd> to view a function&rsquo;s documentation.  You can
save a profile to a file using <kbd class="kbd">C-x C-w</kbd>.  You can compare two
profiles using <kbd class="kbd">=</kbd>.
</p>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-elp_002eel"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-timing-programs"></a>
<p>The <samp class="file">elp</samp> library offers an alternative approach, which is useful
when you know in advance which Lisp function(s) you want to profile.
Using that library, you begin by setting <code class="code">elp-function-list</code> to
the list of function symbols&mdash;those are the functions you want to
profile.  Then type <kbd class="kbd">M-x&nbsp;elp-instrument-list&nbsp;<kbd class="key">RET</kbd>&nbsp;nil&nbsp;<kbd class="key">RET</kbd></kbd><!-- /@w --> to arrange for profiling those functions.  After running
the code you want to profile, invoke <kbd class="kbd">M-x&nbsp;elp-results</kbd><!-- /@w --> to
display the current results.  See the file <samp class="file">elp.el</samp> for more
detailed instructions.  This approach is limited to profiling
functions written in Lisp, it cannot profile Emacs primitives.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-benchmark_002eel"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-benchmarking"></a>
<p>You can measure the time it takes to evaluate individual Emacs Lisp
forms using the <samp class="file">benchmark</samp> library.  See the macros
<code class="code">benchmark-run</code> and <code class="code">benchmark-run-compiled</code> in
<samp class="file">benchmark.el</samp>.  You can also use the <code class="code">benchmark</code> command
for timing forms interactively.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-_002d_002denable_002dprofiling-option-of-configure"></a>
<p>To profile Emacs at the level of its C code, you can build it using the
<samp class="option">--enable-profiling</samp> option of <code class="command">configure</code>.  When Emacs
exits, it generates a file <samp class="file">gmon.out</samp> that you can examine using
the <code class="command">gprof</code> utility.  This feature is mainly useful for
debugging Emacs.  It actually stops the Lisp-level <kbd class="kbd">M-x
profiler-&hellip;</kbd> commands described above from working.
