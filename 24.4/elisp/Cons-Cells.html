<span id="Lists-and-Cons-Cells"></span><h3 class="section">5.1 Lists and Cons Cells</h3>
<span id="index-lists-and-cons-cells"></span>

<p>Lists in Lisp are not a primitive data type; they are built up from
<em>cons cells</em> (see <a href="Cons-Cell-Type.html">Cons Cell Type</a>).  A cons cell is a data
object that represents an ordered pair.  That is, it has two slots,
and each slot <em>holds</em>, or <em>refers to</em>, some Lisp object.  One
slot is known as the <small>CAR</small>, and the other is known as the <small>CDR</small>.
(These names are traditional; see <a href="Cons-Cell-Type.html">Cons Cell Type</a>.)  <small>CDR</small> is
pronounced &ldquo;could-er&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>We say that &ldquo;the <small>CAR</small> of this cons cell is&rdquo; whatever object
its <small>CAR</small> slot currently holds, and likewise for the <small>CDR</small>.
</p>
<p>A list is a series of cons cells &ldquo;chained together&rdquo;, so that each
cell refers to the next one.  There is one cons cell for each element
of the list.  By convention, the <small>CAR</small>s of the cons cells hold the
elements of the list, and the <small>CDR</small>s are used to chain the list
(this asymmetry between <small>CAR</small> and <small>CDR</small> is entirely a matter of
convention; at the level of cons cells, the <small>CAR</small> and <small>CDR</small>
slots have similar properties).  Hence, the <small>CDR</small> slot of each cons
cell in a list refers to the following cons cell.
</p>
<span id="index-true-list"></span>
<p>Also by convention, the <small>CDR</small> of the last cons cell in a list is
<code>nil</code>.  We call such a <code>nil</code>-terminated structure a
<em>true list</em>.  In Emacs Lisp, the symbol <code>nil</code> is both a
symbol and a list with no elements.  For convenience, the symbol
<code>nil</code> is considered to have <code>nil</code> as its <small>CDR</small> (and also
as its <small>CAR</small>).
</p>
<p>Hence, the <small>CDR</small> of a true list is always a true list.  The
<small>CDR</small> of a nonempty true list is a true list containing all the
elements except the first.
</p>
<span id="index-dotted-list"></span>
<span id="index-circular-list"></span>
<p>If the <small>CDR</small> of a list&rsquo;s last cons cell is some value other than
<code>nil</code>, we call the structure a <em>dotted list</em>, since its
printed representation would use dotted pair notation (see <a href="Dotted-Pair-Notation.html">Dotted Pair Notation</a>).  There is one other possibility: some cons cell&rsquo;s
<small>CDR</small> could point to one of the previous cons cells in the list.
We call that structure a <em>circular list</em>.
</p>
<p>For some purposes, it does not matter whether a list is true,
circular or dotted.  If a program doesn&rsquo;t look far enough down the
list to see the <small>CDR</small> of the final cons cell, it won&rsquo;t care.
However, some functions that operate on lists demand true lists and
signal errors if given a dotted list.  Most functions that try to find
the end of a list enter infinite loops if given a circular list.
</p>
<span id="index-list-structure-1"></span>
<p>Because most cons cells are used as part of lists, we refer to any
structure made out of cons cells as a <em>list structure</em>.
