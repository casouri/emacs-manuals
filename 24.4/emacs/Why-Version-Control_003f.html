<p>Version control systems provide you with three important
capabilities:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li><em class="dfn">Reversibility</em>: the ability to back up to a previous state if you
discover that some modification you did was a mistake or a bad idea.

</li><li><em class="dfn">Concurrency</em>: the ability to have many people modifying the same
collection of files knowing that conflicting modifications can be
detected and resolved.

</li><li><em class="dfn">History</em>: the ability to attach historical data to your data,
such as explanatory comments about the intention behind each change to
it.  Even for a programmer working solo, change histories are an
important aid to memory; for a multi-person project, they are a
vitally important form of communication among developers.
