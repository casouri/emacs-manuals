<h4 class="subsection" id="Lexical-Binding-1"><span>12.10.3 Lexical Binding<a class="copiable-link" href="#Lexical-Binding-1"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<p>Lexical binding was introduced to Emacs, as an optional feature, in
version 24.1.  We expect its importance to increase with time.
Lexical binding opens up many more opportunities for optimization, so
programs using it are likely to run faster in future Emacs versions.
Lexical binding is also more compatible with concurrency, which was
added to Emacs in version 26.1.
</p>
<p>A lexically-bound variable has <em class="dfn">lexical scope</em>, meaning that any
reference to the variable must be located textually within the binding
construct.  Here is an example
(see <a class="pxref" href="Using-Lexical-Binding.html">Using Lexical Binding</a>, for how to actually enable lexical binding):
</p>
<div class="example">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">(let ((x 1))    ; <span class="r"><code class="code">x</code> is lexically bound.</span>
  (+ x 3))
     &rArr; 4

(defun getx ()
  x)            ; <span class="r"><code class="code">x</code> is used free in this function.</span>

(let ((x 1))    ; <span class="r"><code class="code">x</code> is lexically bound.</span>
  (getx))
error&rarr; Symbol's value as variable is void: x
</pre></div></div>

<p>Here, the variable <code class="code">x</code> has no global value.  When it is lexically
bound within a <code class="code">let</code> form, it can be used in the textual confines
of that <code class="code">let</code> form.  But it can <em class="emph">not</em> be used from within a
<code class="code">getx</code> function called from the <code class="code">let</code> form, since the
function definition of <code class="code">getx</code> occurs outside the <code class="code">let</code> form
itself.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-lexical-environment"></a>
<p>Here is how lexical binding works.  Each binding construct defines a
<em class="dfn">lexical environment</em>, specifying the variables that are bound
within the construct and their local values.  When the Lisp evaluator
wants the current value of a variable, it looks first in the lexical
environment; if the variable is not specified in there, it looks in
the symbol&rsquo;s value cell, where the dynamic value is stored.
</p>
<p>(Internally, the lexical environment is an alist of symbol-value
pairs, with the final element in the alist being the symbol <code class="code">t</code>
rather than a cons cell.  Such an alist can be passed as the second
argument to the <code class="code">eval</code> function, in order to specify a lexical
environment in which to evaluate a form.  See <a class="xref" href="Eval.html">Eval</a>.  Most Emacs
Lisp programs, however, should not interact directly with lexical
environments in this way; only specialized programs like debuggers.)
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-closures_002c-example-of-using"></a>
<p>Lexical bindings have indefinite extent.  Even after a binding
construct has finished executing, its lexical environment can be
&ldquo;kept around&rdquo; in Lisp objects called <em class="dfn">closures</em>.  A closure is
created when you define a named or anonymous function with lexical
binding enabled.  See <a class="xref" href="Closures.html">Closures</a>, for details.
</p>
<p>When a closure is called as a function, any lexical variable
references within its definition use the retained lexical environment.
Here is an example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(defvar my-ticker nil)   ; <span class="r">We will use this dynamically bound</span>
                         ; <span class="r">variable to store a closure.</span>

(let ((x 0))             ; <span class="r"><code class="code">x</code> is lexically bound.</span>
  (setq my-ticker (lambda ()
                    (setq x (1+ x)))))
    &rArr; (closure ((x . 0) t) ()
          (setq x (1+ x)))

(funcall my-ticker)
    &rArr; 1

(funcall my-ticker)
    &rArr; 2

(funcall my-ticker)
    &rArr; 3

x                        ; <span class="r">Note that <code class="code">x</code> has no global value.</span>
error&rarr; Symbol's value as variable is void: x
</pre></div>

<p>The <code class="code">let</code> binding defines a lexical environment in which the
variable <code class="code">x</code> is locally bound to 0.  Within this binding
construct, we define a lambda expression which increments <code class="code">x</code> by
one and returns the incremented value.  This lambda expression is
automatically turned into a closure, in which the lexical environment
lives on even after the <code class="code">let</code> binding construct has exited.  Each
time we evaluate the closure, it increments <code class="code">x</code>, using the
binding of <code class="code">x</code> in that lexical environment.
</p>
<p>Note that unlike dynamic variables which are tied to the symbol
object itself, the relationship between lexical variables and symbols
is only present in the interpreter (or compiler).  Therefore,
functions which take a symbol argument (like <code class="code">symbol-value</code>,
<code class="code">boundp</code>, and <code class="code">set</code>) can only retrieve or modify a
variable&rsquo;s dynamic binding (i.e., the contents of its symbol&rsquo;s value
cell).
