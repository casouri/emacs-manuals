<p>For a variety of reasons (some of which are fundamental to the Emacs
redisplay code and the complex range of possibilities it handles;
others of which are due to modes and features which do not scale well
in unusual circumstances), Emacs can perform poorly when extremely
long lines are present (where &ldquo;extremely long&rdquo; usually means at
least many thousands of characters).
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-so_002dlong-mode"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-global_002dso_002dlong_002dmode"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-so_002dlong_002daction"></a>
<p>A particular problem is that Emacs may &ldquo;hang&rdquo; for a long time at
the point of visiting a file with extremely long lines.  This can be
mitigated by enabling the <samp class="file">so-long</samp> library, which detects when a
visited file contains abnormally long lines, and takes steps to
disable features which are liable to cause slowness in that situation.
To enable this library, type <kbd class="kbd">M-x global-so-long-mode <kbd class="key">RET</kbd></kbd>,
or turn on the <code class="code">global-so-long-mode</code> in your init file
(see <a class="pxref" href="Init-File.html">The Emacs Initialization File</a>), or customize the <code class="code">global-so-long-mode</code>
option.  You can tailor this mode&rsquo;s operation by customizing the
variable <code class="code">so-long-action</code>.
</p>
<p>The <samp class="file">so-long</samp> library can also significantly improve
performance when moving and editing in a buffer with long lines.
Performance is still likely to degrade as you get deeper into the long
lines, but the improvements from using this library can nevertheless
be substantial.

<p>Use <kbd class="kbd">M-x so-long-commentary</kbd> to view the documentation for this
library and learn more about how to enable and configure it.
