<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-making-pictures-out-of-text-characters"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-picture_002dmode"></a>

<p>To edit a picture made out of text characters (for example, a picture
of the division of a register into fields, as a comment in a program),
use the command <kbd class="kbd">M-x picture-mode</kbd> to enter Picture mode.
</p>
<p>In Picture mode, editing is based on the <em class="dfn">quarter-plane</em> model of
text, according to which the text characters lie studded on an area that
stretches infinitely far to the right and downward.  The concept of the end
of a line does not exist in this model; the most you can say is where the
last nonblank character on the line is found.
</p>
<p>Of course, Emacs really always considers text as a sequence of
characters, and lines really do have ends.  But Picture mode replaces
the most frequently-used commands with variants that simulate the
quarter-plane model of text.  They do this by inserting spaces or by
converting tabs to spaces.
</p>
<p>Most of the basic editing commands of Emacs are redefined by Picture mode
to do essentially the same thing but in a quarter-plane way.  In addition,
Picture mode defines various keys starting with the <kbd class="kbd">C-c</kbd> prefix to
run special picture editing commands.
</p>
<p>One of these keys, <kbd class="kbd">C-c C-c</kbd>, is particularly important.  Often
a picture is part of a larger file that is usually edited in some
other major mode.  Picture mode records the name of the previous major
mode so you can use the <kbd class="kbd">C-c C-c</kbd> command
(<code class="code">picture-mode-exit</code>) later to go back to that mode.  <kbd class="kbd">C-c
C-c</kbd> also deletes spaces from the ends of lines, unless given a
numeric argument.
</p>
<p>The special commands of Picture mode all work in other modes (provided
the <samp class="file">picture</samp> library is loaded), but are not bound to keys except
in Picture mode.  The descriptions below talk of moving &ldquo;one column&rdquo;
and so on, but all the picture mode commands handle numeric arguments as
their normal equivalents do.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-picture_002dmode_002dhook"></a>
<p>Turning on Picture mode runs the hook <code class="code">picture-mode-hook</code>.
Additional extensions to Picture mode can be found in
<samp class="file">artist.el</samp>.
