<p>Emacs can display text written in scripts, such as Arabic, Farsi,
and Hebrew, whose natural ordering for horizontal text display runs
from right to left.  Furthermore, segments of Latin script and digits
embedded in right-to-left text are displayed left-to-right, while
segments of right-to-left script embedded in left-to-right text
(e.g., Arabic or Hebrew text in comments or strings in a program
source file) are appropriately displayed right-to-left.  We call such
mixtures of left-to-right and right-to-left text <em class="dfn">bidirectional
text</em>.  This section describes the facilities and options for editing
and displaying bidirectional text.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-logical-order"></a>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-reordering_002c-of-bidirectional-text"></a>
<p>Text is stored in Emacs buffers and strings in <em class="dfn">logical</em> (or
<em class="dfn">reading</em>) order, i.e., the order in which a human would read
each character.  In right-to-left and bidirectional text, the order in
which characters are displayed on the screen (called <em class="dfn">visual
order</em>) is not the same as logical order; the characters&rsquo; screen
positions do not increase monotonically with string or buffer
position.  In performing this <em class="dfn">bidirectional reordering</em>, Emacs
follows the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (a.k.a. <abbr class="acronym">UBA</abbr>),
which is described in Annex #9 of the Unicode standard
(<a class="url" href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/</a>).  Emacs provides a &ldquo;Full
Bidirectionality&rdquo; class implementation of the <abbr class="acronym">UBA</abbr>,
consistent with the requirements of the Unicode Standard v9.0.  Note,
however, that the way Emacs displays continuation lines when text
direction is opposite to the base paragraph direction deviates from
the UBA, which requires to perform line wrapping before reordering
text for display.
</p>
<dl class="first-defvr first-defvar-alias-first-defvr">
<dt class="defvr defvar-alias-defvr" id="index-bidi_002ddisplay_002dreordering"><span class="category-def">Variable: </span><span><strong class="def-name">bidi-display-reordering</strong><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-bidi_002ddisplay_002dreordering"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>If the value of this buffer-local variable is non-<code class="code">nil</code> (the
default), Emacs performs bidirectional reordering for display.  The
reordering affects buffer text, as well as display strings and overlay
strings from text and overlay properties in the buffer (see <a class="pxref" href="Overlay-Properties.html">Overlay Properties</a>, and see <a class="pxref" href="Display-Property.html">The <code class="code">display</code> Property</a>).  If the value is
<code class="code">nil</code>, Emacs does not perform bidirectional reordering in the
buffer.
</p>
<p>The default value of <code class="code">bidi-display-reordering</code> controls the
reordering of strings which are not directly supplied by a buffer,
including the text displayed in mode lines (see <a class="pxref" href="Mode-Line-Format.html">Mode Line Format</a>)
and header lines (see <a class="pxref" href="Header-Lines.html">Window Header Lines</a>).
</p></dd></dl>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-unibyte-buffers_002c-and-bidi-reordering"></a>
<p>Emacs never reorders the text of a unibyte buffer, even if
<code class="code">bidi-display-reordering</code> is non-<code class="code">nil</code> in the buffer.  This
is because unibyte buffers contain raw bytes, not characters, and thus
lack the directionality properties required for reordering.
Therefore, to test whether text in a buffer will be reordered for
display, it is not enough to test the value of
<code class="code">bidi-display-reordering</code> alone.  The correct test is this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted"> (if (and enable-multibyte-characters
          bidi-display-reordering)
     ;; Buffer is being reordered for display
   )
</pre></div>

<p>However, unibyte display and overlay strings <em class="emph">are</em> reordered if
their parent buffer is reordered.  This is because plain-<small class="sc">ASCII</small>
strings are stored by Emacs as unibyte strings.  If a unibyte display
or overlay string includes non-<small class="sc">ASCII</small> characters, these characters
are assumed to have left-to-right direction.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-display-properties_002c-and-bidi-reordering-of-text"></a>
<p>Text covered by <code class="code">display</code> text properties, by overlays with
<code class="code">display</code> properties whose value is a string, and by any other
properties that replace buffer text, is treated as a single unit when
it is reordered for display.  That is, the entire chunk of text
covered by these properties is reordered together.  Moreover, the
bidirectional properties of the characters in such a chunk of text are
ignored, and Emacs reorders them as if they were replaced with a
single character <code class="code">U+FFFC</code>, known as the <em class="dfn">Object Replacement
Character</em>.  This means that placing a display property over a portion
of text may change the way that the surrounding text is reordered for
display.  To prevent this unexpected effect, always place such
properties on text whose directionality is identical with text that
surrounds it.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-base-direction-of-a-paragraph"></a>
<p>Each paragraph of bidirectional text has a <em class="dfn">base direction</em>,
either right-to-left or left-to-right.  Left-to-right paragraphs are
displayed beginning at the left margin of the window, and are
truncated or continued when the text reaches the right margin.
Right-to-left paragraphs are displayed beginning at the right margin,
and are continued or truncated at the left margin.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-paragraph_002dstart_002c-and-bidirectional-display"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-paragraph_002dseparate_002c-and-bidirectional-display"></a>
<p>Where exactly paragraphs start and end, for the purpose of the Emacs
<abbr class="acronym">UBA</abbr> implementation, is determined by the following two
buffer-local variables (note that <code class="code">paragraph-start</code> and
<code class="code">paragraph-separate</code> have no influence on this).  By default both
of these variables are <code class="code">nil</code>, and paragraphs are bounded by empty
lines, i.e., lines that consist entirely of zero or more whitespace
characters followed by a newline.
</p>
<dl class="first-defvr first-defvar-alias-first-defvr">
<dt class="defvr defvar-alias-defvr" id="index-bidi_002dparagraph_002dstart_002dre"><span class="category-def">Variable: </span><span><strong class="def-name">bidi-paragraph-start-re</strong><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-bidi_002dparagraph_002dstart_002dre"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>If non-<code class="code">nil</code>, this variable&rsquo;s value should be a regular
expression matching a line that starts or separates two paragraphs.
The regular expression is always matched after a newline, so it is
best to anchor it, i.e., begin it with a <code class="code">&quot;^&quot;</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl class="first-defvr first-defvar-alias-first-defvr">
<dt class="defvr defvar-alias-defvr" id="index-bidi_002dparagraph_002dseparate_002dre"><span class="category-def">Variable: </span><span><strong class="def-name">bidi-paragraph-separate-re</strong><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-bidi_002dparagraph_002dseparate_002dre"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>If non-<code class="code">nil</code>, this variable&rsquo;s value should be a regular
expression matching a line separates two paragraphs.  The regular
expression is always matched after a newline, so it is best to anchor
it, i.e., begin it with a <code class="code">&quot;^&quot;</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>If you modify any of these two variables, you should normally modify
both, to make sure they describe paragraphs consistently.  For
example, to have each new line start a new paragraph for
bidi-reordering purposes, set both variables to <code class="code">&quot;^&quot;</code>.
</p>
<p>By default, Emacs determines the base direction of each paragraph by
looking at the text at its beginning.  The precise method of
determining the base direction is specified by the <abbr class="acronym">UBA</abbr>; in a
nutshell, the first character in a paragraph that has an explicit
directionality determines the base direction of the paragraph.
However, sometimes a buffer may need to force a certain base direction
for its paragraphs.  For example, buffers containing program source
code should force all paragraphs to be displayed left-to-right.  You
can use following variable to do this:
</p>
<dl class="first-defvr first-defopt-alias-first-defvr">
<dt class="defvr defopt-alias-defvr" id="index-bidi_002dparagraph_002ddirection"><span class="category-def">User Option: </span><span><strong class="def-name">bidi-paragraph-direction</strong><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-bidi_002dparagraph_002ddirection"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>If the value of this buffer-local variable is the symbol
<code class="code">right-to-left</code> or <code class="code">left-to-right</code>, all paragraphs in the
buffer are assumed to have that specified direction.  Any other value
is equivalent to <code class="code">nil</code> (the default), which means to determine
the base direction of each paragraph from its contents.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-prog_002dmode_002c-and-bidi_002dparagraph_002ddirection"></a>
<p>Modes for program source code should set this to <code class="code">left-to-right</code>.
Prog mode does this by default, so modes derived from Prog mode do not
need to set this explicitly (see <a class="pxref" href="Basic-Major-Modes.html">Basic Major Modes</a>).
</p></dd></dl>

<dd><p>This function returns the paragraph direction at point in the named

<code class="code">left-to-right</code> or <code class="code">right-to-left</code>.  If <var class="var">buffer</var> is
omitted or <code class="code">nil</code>, it defaults to the current buffer.  If the
buffer-local value of the variable <code class="code">bidi-paragraph-direction</code> is
non-<code class="code">nil</code>, the returned value will be identical to that value;
otherwise, the returned value reflects the paragraph direction
determined dynamically by Emacs.  For buffers whose value of
<code class="code">bidi-display-reordering</code> is <code class="code">nil</code> as well as unibyte
buffers, this function always returns <code class="code">left-to-right</code>.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-visual_002dorder-cursor-motion"></a>
<p>Sometimes there&rsquo;s a need to move point in strict visual order,
either to the left or to the right of its current screen position.
Emacs provides a primitive to do that.
</p>
<dl class="first-deffn first-defun-alias-first-deffn">

<dd><p>This function moves point of the currently selected window to the

move one screen position to the right, otherwise it will move one
screen position to the left.  Note that, depending on the surrounding
bidirectional context, this could potentially move point many buffer
positions away.  If invoked at the end of a screen line, the function
moves point to the rightmost or leftmost screen position of the next
or previous screen line, as appropriate for the value of
<var class="var">direction</var>.
</p>
<p>The function returns the new buffer position as its value.
</p></dd></dl>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-layout-on-display_002c-and-bidirectional-text"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-jumbled-display-of-bidirectional-text"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-concatenating-bidirectional-strings"></a>
<p>Bidirectional reordering can have surprising and unpleasant effects
when two strings with bidirectional content are juxtaposed in a
buffer, or otherwise programmatically concatenated into a string of
text.  A typical problematic case is when a buffer consists of
sequences of text fields separated by whitespace or punctuation
characters, like Buffer Menu mode or Rmail Summary Mode.  Because the
punctuation characters used as separators have <em class="dfn">weak
directionality</em>, they take on the directionality of surrounding text.
As result, a numeric field that follows a field with bidirectional
content can be displayed <em class="emph">to the left</em> of the preceding field,
messing up the expected layout.  There are several ways to avoid this
problem:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-minus">
<li>Append the special character U+200E <small class="sc">LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK</small>, or
<abbr class="acronym">LRM</abbr>, to the end of each field that may have bidirectional
content, or prepend it to the beginning of the following field.  The
function <code class="code">bidi-string-mark-left-to-right</code>, described below, comes
in handy for this purpose.  (In a right-to-left paragraph, use
U+200F <small class="sc">RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK</small>, or <abbr class="acronym">RLM</abbr>, instead.)  This
is one of the solutions recommended by the UBA.

</li><li>Include the tab character in the field separator.  The tab character
plays the role of <em class="dfn">segment separator</em> in bidirectional reordering,
causing the text on either side to be reordered separately.

</li><li><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-space-display-spec_002c-and-bidirectional-text"></a>
Separate fields with a <code class="code">display</code> property or overlay with a
property value of the form <code class="code">(space . PROPS)</code> (see <a class="pxref" href="Specified-Space.html">Specified Spaces</a>).  Emacs treats this display specification as a <em class="dfn">paragraph
separator</em>, and reorders the text on either side separately.
</li></ul>

<dl class="first-deffn first-defun-alias-first-deffn">
<dt class="deffn defun-alias-deffn" id="index-bidi_002dstring_002dmark_002dleft_002dto_002dright"><span class="category-def">Function: </span><span><strong class="def-name">bidi-string-mark-left-to-right</strong> <var class="def-var-arguments">string</var><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-bidi_002dstring_002dmark_002dleft_002dto_002dright"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns its argument <var class="var">string</var>, possibly modified,
such that the result can be safely concatenated with another string,
or juxtaposed with another string in a buffer, without disrupting the
relative layout of this string and the next one on display.  If the
string returned by this function is displayed as part of a
left-to-right paragraph, it will always appear on display to the left
of the text that follows it.  The function works by examining the
characters of its argument, and if any of those characters could cause
reordering on display, the function appends the <abbr class="acronym">LRM</abbr>
character to the string.  The appended <abbr class="acronym">LRM</abbr> character is made
invisible by giving it an <code class="code">invisible</code> text property of <code class="code">t</code>
(see <a class="pxref" href="Invisible-Text.html">Invisible Text</a>).
</p></dd></dl>

<p>The reordering algorithm uses the bidirectional properties of the
characters stored as their <code class="code">bidi-class</code> property
(see <a class="pxref" href="Character-Properties.html">Character Properties</a>).  Lisp programs can change these
properties by calling the <code class="code">put-char-code-property</code> function.
However, doing this requires a thorough understanding of the
<abbr class="acronym">UBA</abbr>, and is therefore not recommended.  Any changes to the
bidirectional properties of a character have global effect: they
affect all Emacs frames and windows.
</p>
<p>Similarly, the <code class="code">mirroring</code> property is used to display the
appropriate mirrored character in the reordered text.  Lisp programs
can affect the mirrored display by changing this property.  Again, any
such changes affect all of Emacs display.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-overriding-bidirectional-properties"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-directional-overrides"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-LRO"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-RLO"></a>
<p>The bidirectional properties of characters can be overridden by
inserting into the text special directional control characters,
LEFT-TO-RIGHT OVERRIDE (<abbr class="acronym">LRO</abbr>) and RIGHT-TO-LEFT OVERRIDE
(<abbr class="acronym">RLO</abbr>).  Any characters between a <abbr class="acronym">RLO</abbr> and the
following newline or POP DIRECTIONAL FORMATTING (<abbr class="acronym">PDF</abbr>)
control character, whichever comes first, will be displayed as if they
were strong right-to-left characters, i.e. they will be reversed on
display.  Similarly, any characters between <abbr class="acronym">LRO</abbr> and
<abbr class="acronym">PDF</abbr> or newline will display as if they were strong
left-to-right, and will <em class="emph">not</em> be reversed even if they are strong
right-to-left characters.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-phishing-using-directional-overrides"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-malicious-use-of-directional-overrides"></a>
<p>These overrides are useful when you want to make some text
unaffected by the reordering algorithm, and instead directly control
the display order.  But they can also be used for malicious purposes,
known as <em class="dfn">phishing</em>.  Specifically, a URL on a Web page or a link
in an email message can be manipulated to make its visual appearance
unrecognizable, or similar to some popular benign location, while the
real location, interpreted by a browser in the logical order, is very
different.
</p>
<p>Emacs provides a primitive that applications can use to detect
instances of text whose bidirectional properties were overridden so as
to make a left-to-right character display as if it were a
right-to-left character, or vice versa.
</p>
<dl class="first-deffn first-defun-alias-first-deffn">
<dt class="deffn defun-alias-deffn" id="index-bidi_002dfind_002doverridden_002ddirectionality"><span class="category-def">Function: </span><span><strong class="def-name">bidi-find-overridden-directionality</strong> <var class="def-var-arguments">from to &amp;optional object</var><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-bidi_002dfind_002doverridden_002ddirectionality"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>This function looks at the text of the specified <var class="var">object</var> between
positions <var class="var">from</var> (inclusive) and <var class="var">to</var> (exclusive), and returns
the first position where it finds a strong left-to-right character
whose directional properties were forced to display the character as
right-to-left, or for a strong right-to-left character that was forced
to display as left-to-right.  If it finds no such characters in the
specified region of text, it returns <code class="code">nil</code>.
</p>
<p>The optional argument <var class="var">object</var> specifies which text to search, and
defaults to the current buffer.  If <var class="var">object</var> is non-<code class="code">nil</code>, it
can be some other buffer, or it can be a string or a window.  If it is
a string, the function searches that string.  If it is a window, the
function searches the buffer displayed in that window.  If a buffer
whose text you want to examine is displayed in some window, we
recommend to specify it by that window, rather than pass the buffer to
the function.  This is because telling the function about the window
allows it to correctly account for window-specific overlays, which
might change the result of the function if some text in the buffer is
covered by overlays.

<p>When text that includes mixed right-to-left and left-to-right
characters and bidirectional controls is copied into a different
location, it can change its visual appearance, and also can affect the
visual appearance of the surrounding text at destination.  This is
because reordering of bidirectional text specified by the
<abbr class="acronym">UBA</abbr> has non-trivial context-dependent effects both on the
copied text and on the text at copy destination that will surround it.
</p>
<p>Sometimes, a Lisp program may need to preserve the exact visual
appearance of the copied text at destination, and of the text that
surrounds the copy.  Lisp programs can use the following function to
achieve that effect.
