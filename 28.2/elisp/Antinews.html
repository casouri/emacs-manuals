<h2 class="appendix" id="Emacs-27-Antinews"><span>Appendix A Emacs 27 Antinews<a class="copiable-link" href="#Emacs-27-Antinews"> &para;</a></span></h2>

<p>For those users who live backwards in time, here is information about
downgrading to Emacs version 27.2.  We hope you will enjoy the greater
simplicity that results from the absence of many Emacs&nbsp;28.2<!-- /@w --> features.
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>The annoying <code class="code">lexical-binding</code> local variable now heeds the
value of <code class="code">enable-local-variables</code>: if it&rsquo;s <code class="code">nil</code>, the
<code class="code">lexical-binding</code> cookie is ignored.  We are working hard on
removing the lexical-binding support in some past Emacs version, and
this small step advances us back to that change.

</li><li>The <code class="code">load-dangerous-libraries</code> variable is not obsolete, as it
must be used to allow loading Lisp compiled by XEmacs, which will
become more and more important as you move back in time.

</li><li>The optional <var class="var">modes</var> argument of <code class="code">interactive</code> is not
supported, and every command is deemed applicable to any major mode.
We believe this makes the life of Lisp programmers much simpler, as
there&rsquo;s now no need to tag commands with the modes where they make
sense.

</li><li>Shorthands for Lisp symbols have been removed, which makes loading
Lisp files and handling Lisp symbols much simpler and more efficient.
This is important for decent performance on slower CPUs as you move
back in time.

</li><li>To reduce the amount of code in Emacs related to unimportant features,
we&rsquo;ve removed the variables <code class="code">global-minor-modes</code> and
<code class="code">local-minor-modes</code>.  If your Lisp program needs to determine
whether some minor mode is in effect, it will have to test explicitly
for every mode.  We don&rsquo;t expect anyone to miss those fancy variables.

</li><li>The default preference for servicing sub-processes that produce output
at a high rate, and the associated variable
<code class="code">process-prioritize-lower-fds</code>, have been removed.  Moving back
in time means fewer and fewer programs can produce such high-rate
output, so this features becomes just useless crud.

</li><li>The encodings that are variants of EBCDIC were removed.  This includes
<code class="code">ibm256</code>, <code class="code">ibm273</code>, and others&mdash;variants of the EBCDIC
encoding tailored for some Japanese and European locales.  You won&rsquo;t
need those where you are going.

</li><li>The &ldquo;Bindat type expression&rdquo; description language has been removed,
as the existing data layout specifications are perfectly suited for
this job.

</li><li>To simplify code and reduce complexity, we removed the capability of
specifying the success handler in <code class="code">condition-case</code> via the
<code class="code">:success</code> keyword.  If you really need this feature (why would
you?), you can always write some simple Lisp that has the same effect.

</li><li>Emacs modules can no longer provide interactive functions, or install
finalizers, nor open channels to existing pipe sub-processes.  All
this is extra ballast, especially since we plan on removing modules in
some past Emacs version.  The <code class="code">make_unibyte_string</code> module API
was removed for the same reason.

</li><li>To keep Emacs clean and elegant, we&rsquo;ve removed the
<code class="code">print-integers-as-characters</code> option.  Recognizing characters by
their decimal codes is a basic requirement for Emacs Lisp programmers,
and with the expected decrease in use of Unicode characters, this will
be soon limited to ASCII only: surely something you all can master!

</li><li>The optional <var class="var">count</var> argument of the <code class="code">directory-files</code>
function has been removed.  Extracting the first <var class="var">n</var> members from
the full list is trivial, so this is a significant simplification for
an insignificant cost.

</li><li>Functions that create sub-processes and network connections no longer
accept the <code class="code">:coding</code> argument; use
<code class="code">set-process-coding-system</code> or bind
<code class="code">coding-system-for-read/write</code> instead: again, a significant
reduction in Emacs complexity for little or no cost.

</li><li>We deleted from the macros <code class="code">define-derived-mode</code> and
<code class="code">define-minor-mode</code> the code which allowed using the
<code class="code">:interactive</code> argument.  The possibility of marking a mode
non-interactive makes very little sense,

</li><li>The possibility of having links to man pages in doc strings has been
removed.  Use plain text instead, if you need such references.

</li><li>Temporary buffers are no longer exempt from running any buffer-related
hooks.  Programs that don&rsquo;t want such hooks in some buffer can always
disable it locally, whereas making that simpler complicates Emacs for
no good reason.

</li><li>Several features that complicated the byte compiler have been removed:

<ul class="itemize mark-minus">
<li>The checks for missing declarations of dynamic variables.  This will
continue making less and less sense as we move away of lexical-binding
support.

</li><li>The ability of compiling symlinked <samp class="file">*.el</samp> files, which is really
gross: copy the files instead.

</li><li>The warnings about too-wide doc strings&mdash;that is just a nuisance, as
the programmers should be trusted to know what they are doing.
</li></ul>


</li><li>We deleted several features of the <code class="code">pcase</code> macro, in accordance
with our general plan to remove <code class="code">pcase</code> from Emacs:

<ul class="itemize mark-minus">
<li>The <code class="code">cl-type</code> pattern.

</li><li>the <code class="code">pcase-setq</code> macro.

</li><li>The <code class="code">pcase-compile-patterns</code> function.
</li></ul>

</li><li>Some of the keywords used in Edebug specification lists were deemed to
be of little use, and were therefore removed: <code class="code">&amp;interpose</code>,
<code class="code">&amp;error</code>, and <code class="code">&amp;name</code>.  The long-term plane is for Emacs to
drop Edebug entirely, leaving only the trusted Lisp debugger, and we
continue working according to that plan.

</li><li>The function <code class="code">object-intervals</code> was dropped, as a Lisp program
can easily collect the intervals of a buffer or a string by iterating
through them one by one.

</li><li>We decided that the <code class="code">require-theme</code> function is an unnecessary
complication, so we deleted it.  Lisp programs can easily search along
<code class="code">custom-theme-load-path</code> instead.

</li><li>The convenience functions <code class="code">length&lt;</code>, <code class="code">length&gt;</code>, and
<code class="code">length=</code> were removed, as using <code class="code">length</code> followed by a
comparison should be good enough for everyone, especially considering
that the typical length of a list keeps going down as you move back
through time.

</li><li>The variable <code class="code">current-minibuffer-command</code> is no longer available,
as we found little justification for keeping it.

</li><li>As part of the ongoing quest for simplicity, many other functions and
variables have been eliminated.  Other functions and variables, that
were declared obsolete since Emacs 23, have been added back, in
preparation for releasing Emacs 23 in some distant past.
