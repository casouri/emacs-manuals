<span id="index-advising-named-functions"></span>

<p>A common use of advice is for named functions and macros.
You could just use <code>add-function</code> as in:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(add-function :around (symbol-function '<var>fun</var>) #'his-tracing-function)
</pre></div>

<p>But you should use <code>advice-add</code> and <code>advice-remove</code> for that
instead.  This separate set of functions to manipulate pieces of advice applied
to named functions, offers the following extra features compared to
<code>add-function</code>: they know how to deal with macros and autoloaded
functions, they let <code>describe-function</code> preserve the original docstring as
well as document the added advice, and they let you add and remove advice
before a function is even defined.
</p>
<p><code>advice-add</code> can be useful for altering the behavior of existing calls
to an existing function without having to redefine the whole function.
However, it can be a source of bugs, since existing callers to the function may
assume the old behavior, and work incorrectly when the behavior is changed by
advice.  Advice can also cause confusion in debugging, if the person doing the
debugging does not notice or remember that the function has been modified
by advice.
</p>
<p>For these reasons, advice should be reserved for the cases where you
cannot modify a function&rsquo;s behavior in any other way.  If it is
possible to do the same thing via a hook, that is preferable
(see <a href="Hooks.html">Hooks</a>).  If you simply want to change what a particular key
does, it may be better to write a new command, and remap the old
command&rsquo;s key bindings to the new one (see <a href="Remapping-Commands.html">Remapping Commands</a>).
In particular, Emacs&rsquo;s own source files should not put advice on
functions in Emacs.  (There are currently a few exceptions to this
convention, but we aim to correct them.)
</p>
<p>Special forms (see <a href="Special-Forms.html">Special Forms</a>) cannot be advised, however macros can
be advised, in much the same way as functions.  Of course, this will not affect
code that has already been macro-expanded, so you need to make sure the advice
is installed before the macro is expanded.
</p>
<p>It is possible to advise a primitive (see <a href="What-Is-a-Function.html">What Is a Function</a>),
but one should typically <em>not</em> do so, for two reasons.  Firstly,
some primitives are used by the advice mechanism, and advising them
could cause an infinite recursion.  Secondly, many primitives are
called directly from C, and such calls ignore advice; hence, one ends
up in a confusing situation where some calls (occurring from Lisp
code) obey the advice and other calls (from C code) do not.

<dl>
<dt id="index-define_002dadvice">Macro: <strong>define-advice</strong> <em>symbol (where lambda-list &amp;optional name depth) &amp;rest body</em></dt>
<dd><p>This macro defines a piece of advice and adds it to the function named
<var>symbol</var>.  The advice is an anonymous function if <var>name</var> is
nil or a function named <code>symbol@name</code>.  See <code>advice-add</code>
for explanation of other arguments.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-advice_002dadd">Function: <strong>advice-add</strong> <em>symbol where function &amp;optional props</em></dt>
<dd><p>Add the advice <var>function</var> to the named function <var>symbol</var>.
<var>where</var> and <var>props</var> have the same meaning as for <code>add-function</code>
(see <a href="Core-Advising-Primitives.html">Core Advising Primitives</a>).
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-advice_002dremove">Function: <strong>advice-remove</strong> <em>symbol function</em></dt>

a piece of advice.

<dl>
<dt id="index-advice_002dmapc">Function: <strong>advice-mapc</strong> <em>function symbol</em></dt>
<dd><p>Call <var>function</var> for every piece of advice that was added to the
named function <var>symbol</var>.  <var>function</var> is called with two
arguments: the advice function and its properties.
