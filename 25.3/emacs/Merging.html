<p>While developing a branch, you may sometimes need to <em class="dfn">merge</em> in
changes that have already been made in another branch.  This is not a
trivial operation, as overlapping changes may have been made to the
two branches.
</p>
<p>On a decentralized version control system, merging is done with the
command <kbd class="kbd">C-x v m</kbd> (<code class="code">vc-merge</code>).  On Bazaar, this prompts for
the exact arguments to pass to <code class="command">bzr merge</code>, offering a
sensible default if possible.  On Git, this prompts for the name of a
branch to merge from, with completion (based on the branch names known
to the current repository).  The output from running the merge command
is shown in a separate buffer.
</p>
<p>On a centralized version control system like CVS, <kbd class="kbd">C-x v m</kbd>
prompts for a branch ID, or a pair of revision IDs (see <a class="pxref" href="Switching-Branches.html">Switching between Branches</a>); then it finds the changes from that branch, or the changes
between the two revisions you specified, and merges those changes into
the current VC fileset.  If you just type <kbd class="key">RET</kbd>, Emacs simply
merges any changes that were made on the same branch since you checked
the file out.
</p>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-resolving-conflicts"></a>
<p>Immediately after performing a merge, only the working tree is
modified, and you can review the changes produced by the merge with
<kbd class="kbd">C-x v D</kbd> and related commands (see <a class="pxref" href="Old-Revisions.html">Examining And Comparing Old Revisions</a>).  If the
two branches contained overlapping changes, merging produces a
<em class="dfn">conflict</em>; a warning appears in the output of the merge command,
and <em class="dfn">conflict markers</em> are inserted into each affected work file,
surrounding the two sets of conflicting changes.  You must then
resolve the conflict by editing the conflicted files.  Once you are
done, the modified files must be committed in the usual way for the
merge to take effect (see <a class="pxref" href="Basic-VC-Editing.html">Basic Editing under Version Control</a>).
