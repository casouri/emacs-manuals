<p>During the merge, you mustn&rsquo;t try to edit the A and B buffers yourself.
Emerge modifies them temporarily, but ultimately puts them back the way
they were.
</p>
<p>You can have any number of merges going at once&mdash;just don&rsquo;t use any one
buffer as input to more than one merge at once, since the temporary
changes made in these buffers would get in each other&rsquo;s way.
</p>
<p>Starting Emerge can take a long time because it needs to compare the
files fully.  Emacs can&rsquo;t do anything else until <code class="code">diff</code> finishes.
Perhaps in the future someone will change Emerge to do the comparison in
the background when the input files are large&mdash;then you could keep on
doing other things with Emacs until Emerge is ready to accept
commands.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-emerge_002dstartup_002dhook"></a>
<p>After setting up the merge, Emerge runs the hook
<code class="code">emerge-startup-hook</code>.
See <a class="xref" href="Hooks.html">Hooks</a>.
