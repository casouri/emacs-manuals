<p>Emacs supports four kinds of mouse events: click events, drag events,
button-down events, and motion events.  All mouse events are represented
as lists.  The <small class="sc">CAR</small> of the list is the event type; this says which
mouse button was involved, and which modifier keys were used with it.
The event type can also distinguish double or triple button presses
(see <a class="pxref" href="Repeat-Events.html">Repeat Events</a>).  The rest of the list elements give position
and time information.
</p>
<p>For key lookup, only the event type matters: two events of the same type
necessarily run the same command.  The command can access the full
values of these events using the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">e</samp>&rsquo; interactive code.
See <a class="xref" href="Interactive-Codes.html">Code Characters for <code class="code">interactive</code></a>.
</p>
<p>A key sequence that starts with a mouse event is read using the keymaps
of the buffer in the window that the mouse was in, not the current
buffer.  This does not imply that clicking in a window selects that
window or its buffer&mdash;that is entirely under the control of the command
binding of the key sequence.
