<p>In its most simplistic form, a frame accommodates always one single
window that can be used for displaying a buffer.  As a consequence, it
is always the latest call of <code class="code">display-buffer</code> that will have
succeeded in placing its buffer there.
</p>
<p>Since working with such a frame is not very practical, Emacs by
default allows for more complex frame layouts controlled by the
default values of the frame size and the <code class="code">split-height-threshold</code>
and <code class="code">split-width-threshold</code> options.  Displaying a buffer not yet
shown on a frame then either splits the single window on that frame or
(re-)uses one of its two windows.
</p>
<p>The default behavior is abandoned as soon as the user customizes
one of these thresholds or manually changes the frame&rsquo;s layout.  The
default behavior is also abandoned when calling <code class="code">display-buffer</code>
with a non-<code class="code">nil</code> <var class="var">action</var> argument or the user customizes one
of the options mentioned in the previous subsections.  Mastering
<code class="code">display-buffer</code> soon may become a frustrating experience due to
the plethora of applicable display actions and the resulting frame
layouts.
</p>
<p>However, refraining from using buffer display functions and falling
back on a split &amp; delete windows metaphor is not a good idea either.
Buffer display functions give Lisp programs and users a framework to
reconcile their different needs; no comparable framework exists for
splitting and deleting windows.  Buffer display functions also allow
to at least partially restore the layout of a frame when removing a
buffer from it later (see <a class="pxref" href="Quitting-Windows.html">Quitting Windows</a>).
</p>
<p>Below we will give a number of guidelines to redeem the frustration
mentioned above and thus to avoid literally losing buffers in-between
the windows of a frame.
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt>Write display actions without stress</dt>
<dd><p>Writing display actions can be a pain because one has to lump together
action functions and action alists in one huge list.  (Historical
reasons prevented us from having <code class="code">display-buffer</code> support
separate arguments for these.)  It might help to memorize some basic
forms like the ones listed below:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">'(nil (inhibit-same-window . t))
</pre></div>

<p>specifies an action alist entry only and no action function.  Its sole
purpose is to inhibit a <code class="code">display-buffer-same-window</code> function
specified elsewhere from showing the buffer in the same window, see
also the last example of the preceding subsection.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">'(display-buffer-below-selected)
</pre></div>

<p>on the other hand, specifies one action function and an empty action
alist.  To combine the effects of the above two specifications one
would write the form
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">'(display-buffer-below-selected (inhibit-same-window . t))
</pre></div>

<p>to add another action function one would write
</p>
<div class="example">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">'((display-buffer-below-selected display-buffer-at-bottom)
  (inhibit-same-window . t))
</pre></div></div>

<p>and to add another alist entry one would write
</p>
<div class="example">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">'((display-buffer-below-selected display-buffer-at-bottom)
  (inhibit-same-window . t)
  (window-height . fit-window-to-buffer))
</pre></div></div>

<p>That last form can be used as <var class="var">action</var> argument of
<code class="code">display-buffer</code> in the following way:
</p>
<div class="example">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">(display-buffer
 (get-buffer-create &quot;*foo*&quot;)
 '((display-buffer-below-selected display-buffer-at-bottom)
   (inhibit-same-window . t)
   (window-height . fit-window-to-buffer)))
</pre></div></div>

<p>In a customization of <code class="code">display-buffer-alist</code> it would be used as
follows:
</p>
<div class="example">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">(setopt
 display-buffer-alist
 '((&quot;\\*foo\\*&quot;
    (display-buffer-below-selected display-buffer-at-bottom)
    (inhibit-same-window . t)
    (window-height . fit-window-to-buffer))))
</pre></div></div>

<p>To add a customization for a second buffer one would then write:
</p>
<div class="example">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">(setopt
 display-buffer-alist
 '((&quot;\\*foo\\*&quot;
    (display-buffer-below-selected display-buffer-at-bottom)
    (inhibit-same-window . t)
    (window-height . fit-window-to-buffer))
   (&quot;\\*bar\\*&quot;
    (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-pop-up-frame)
    (reusable-frames . visible))))
</pre></div></div>

</dd>
<dt>Treat each other with respect</dt>
<dd><p><code class="code">display-buffer-alist</code> and <code class="code">display-buffer-base-action</code> are
user options&mdash;Lisp programs must never set or rebind them.
<code class="code">display-buffer-overriding-action</code>, on the other hand, is
reserved for applications&mdash;who seldom use that option and if they use
it, then with utmost care.
</p>
<p>Older implementations of <code class="code">display-buffer</code> frequently caused
users and applications to fight over the settings of user options like
<code class="code">pop-up-frames</code> and <code class="code">pop-up-windows</code> (see <a class="pxref" href="Choosing-Window-Options.html">Additional Options for Displaying Buffers</a>).  This was one major reason for redesigning
<code class="code">display-buffer</code>&mdash;to provide a clear framework specifying what
users and applications should be allowed to do.
</p>
<p>Lisp programs must be prepared that user customizations may
cause buffers to get displayed in an unexpected way.  They should
never assume in their subsequent behavior, that the buffer has been
shown precisely the way they asked for in the <var class="var">action</var> argument of
<code class="code">display-buffer</code>.
</p>
<p>Users should not pose too many and too severe restrictions on how
arbitrary buffers get displayed.  Otherwise, they will risk to lose
the characteristics of showing a buffer for a certain purpose.
Suppose a Lisp program has been written to compare different versions
of a buffer in two windows side-by-side.  If the customization of
<code class="code">display-buffer-alist</code> prescribes that any such buffer should be
always shown in or below the selected window, the program will have a
hard time to set up the desired window configuration via
<code class="code">display-buffer</code>.
</p>
<p>To specify a preference for showing an arbitrary buffer, users
should customize <code class="code">display-buffer-base-action</code>.  An example of how
users who prefer working with multiple frames would do that was given
in the previous subsection.  <code class="code">display-buffer-alist</code> should be
reserved for displaying specific buffers in a specific way.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Consider reusing a window that already shows the buffer</dt>
<dd><p>Generally, it&rsquo;s always a good idea for users and Lisp
programmers to be prepared for the case that a window already shows
the buffer in question and to reuse that window.  In the preceding
subsection we have shown that failing to do so properly may cause
<code class="code">display-buffer</code> to continuously pop up a new frame although a
frame showing that buffer existed already.  In a few cases only, it
might be undesirable to reuse a window, for example, when a different
portion of the buffer should be shown in that window.
</p>
<p>Hence, <code class="code">display-buffer-reuse-window</code> is one action function
that should be used as often as possible, both in <var class="var">action</var>
arguments and customizations.  An <code class="code">inhibit-same-window</code> entry in
the <var class="var">action</var> argument usually takes care of the most common case
where reusing a window showing the buffer should be avoided&mdash;that
where the window in question is the selected one.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Attract focus to the window chosen</dt>
<dd><p>This is a no-brainer for people working with multiple frames&mdash;the
frame showing the buffer will automatically raise and get focus unless
an <code class="code">inhibit-switch-frame</code> entry forbids it.  For single frame
users this task can be considerably more difficult.  In particular,
<code class="code">display-buffer-pop-up-window</code> and
<code class="code">display-buffer-use-some-window</code> can become obtrusive in this
regard.  They split or use a seemingly arbitrary (often the largest or
least recently used) window, distracting the user&rsquo;s attention.
</p>
<p>Some Lisp programs therefore try to choose a window at the bottom of
the frame, for example, in order to display the buffer in vicinity of
the minibuffer window where the user is expected to answer a question
related to the new window.  For non-input related actions
<code class="code">display-buffer-below-selected</code> might be preferable because the
selected window usually already has the user&rsquo;s attention.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Take care which window is selected</dt>
<dd><p>Many applications call <code class="code">display-buffer</code> from within window
excursions produced by <code class="code">with-selected-window</code> or
<code class="code">select-window</code> calls with a non-<code class="code">nil</code> <var class="var">norecord</var>
argument.  This is almost always a bad idea because the window selected
within such an excursion is usually not the window selected in the
configuration presented to the user.
</p>
<p>If, for example, a user had added an <code class="code">inhibit-same-window</code> alist
entry, that entry would have avoided the window selected within the
scope of the excursion and not the window selected in the resulting
configuration.  Even if no such entry has been added, the resulting
behavior might be strange.  While in a frame containing one live
window, evaluating the following form
</p>
<div class="example">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">(progn
  (split-window)
  (display-buffer &quot;*Messages*&quot;))
</pre></div></div>

<p>will display a window showing the <samp class="file">*Messages*</samp> buffer at the bottom
and leave the other window selected.  Evaluating the next form
</p>
<div class="example">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">(with-selected-window (split-window)
  (display-buffer &quot;*Messages*&quot;))
</pre></div></div>

<p>will display <samp class="file">*Messages*</samp> in a window on the top and select it
which is usually not what <code class="code">display-buffer</code> is supposed to do.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, while evaluating the following form
</p>
<div class="example">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">(progn
  (split-window)
  (pop-to-buffer &quot;*Messages*&quot;))
</pre></div></div>

<p>will correctly select the <samp class="file">*Messages*</samp> buffer, the next form
</p>
<div class="example">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">(progn
  (split-window)
  (with-selected-window (selected-window)
    (pop-to-buffer &quot;*Messages*&quot;)))
</pre></div></div>

<p>will not.
</p>
<p>Also, invocations of action functions like
<code class="code">display-buffer-use-some-window</code> and
<code class="code">display-buffer-use-least-recent-window</code> that expect the selected
window to have the highest use time among all windows, may fail to
produce a window according to their specifications.
</p>
<p>Hence, an application that relies on using a window excursion should try
to postpone the <code class="code">display-buffer</code> call until after the excursion has
terminated.
