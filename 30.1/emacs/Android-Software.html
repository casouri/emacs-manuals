<p>An exceptionally limited set of Unix-like command line tools is
distributed alongside default installations of Android.  Several
projects exist to augment this selection, providing options that range
from improved reproductions of Unix command-line utilities to package
repositories providing extensive collections of free GNU and Unix
software.
</p>
<p><a class="uref" href="https://busybox.net">Busybox</a> provides Unix utilities and
limited replicas of certain popular GNU programs such as
<code class="command">wget</code> in a single statically-linked Linux binary, which is
capable of running under Android.
</p>
<p><a class="uref" href="https://termux.dev">Termux</a> provides a package manager based
on the Debian project&rsquo;s <code class="command">dpkg</code> system and a set of package
repositories containing substantial amounts of free software for Unix
systems, including compilers, debuggers, and runtimes for languages
such as C, C++, Java, Python and Common Lisp.  These packages are
customarily installed from within a purpose-built terminal emulator
application, but access is also granted to Emacs when it is built with
the same application signing key, and its &ldquo;shared user ID&rdquo; is set to
the same package name, as that of the terminal emulator program.  The
file <samp class="file">java/INSTALL</samp> within the Emacs distribution illustrates how
to build Emacs in this fashion.
</p>
<p><a class="uref" href="https://github.com/termux/termux-packages">termux-packages</a>
provides the package definitions used by Termux to generate their
package repositories, which may also be independently compiled for
installation within Emacs&rsquo;s home directory.
</p>
<p>In addition to the projects mentioned above, statically linked
binaries for most Linux kernel-based systems can also be run on
Android.
