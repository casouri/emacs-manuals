<p>Emacs runs inside an operating system such as GNU/Linux, and relies on
the operating system to check security constraints such as accesses to
files.  The default settings for Emacs are designed for typical use;
they may require some tailoring in environments where security is more
of a concern, or less of a concern, than usual.  For example,
file-local variables can be risky, and you can set the variable
<code class="code">enable-local-variables</code> to <code class="code">:safe</code> or (even more
conservatively) to <code class="code">nil</code>; conversely, if your files can all be
trusted and the default checking for these variables is irritating,
you can set <code class="code">enable-local-variables</code> to <code class="code">:all</code>.  See <a class="xref" href="Safe-File-Variables.html">Safety of File Variables</a>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-trusted-files-and-directories"></a>
<p>Loading a file of Emacs Lisp code with <code class="code">load-file</code> or
<code class="code">load-library</code> (see <a class="pxref" href="Lisp-Libraries.html">Libraries of Lisp Code for Emacs</a>) can execute some of the
Lisp code in the file being loaded, so you should only load Lisp files
whose source you trust.  However, some Emacs features can in certain
situations execute Lisp code even without your explicit command or
request.  For example, Flymake, the on-the-fly syntax checker for Emacs
(see <cite class="cite"><a data-manual="flymake" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/flymake/index.html#Top">GNU Flymake</a></cite>), if it is enabled, can
automatically execute some of the code in a Lisp file you visit as part
of its syntax-checking job.  Similarly, some completion commands
(see <a class="pxref" href="Completion.html">Completion</a>) in buffers visiting Lisp files sometimes need to
expand Lisp macros for best results.  In these cases, just visiting a
Lisp file and performing some editing in it could trigger execution of
Lisp code.  If the visited file came from an untrusted source, it could
include dangerous or even malicious code that Emacs would execute in
those situations.
</p>
<p>To protect against this, Emacs disables execution of Lisp code by
Flymake, completion, and some other features, unless the visited file is
<em class="dfn">trusted</em>.  It is up to you to specify which files on your system
should be trusted, by customizing the user option
<code class="code">trusted-content</code>.
</p>
<dl class="first-defvr first-defopt-alias-first-defvr">
<dt class="defvr defopt-alias-defvr" id="index-trusted_002dcontent"><span class="category-def">User Option: </span><span><strong class="def-name">trusted-content</strong><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-trusted_002dcontent"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>The value of this option is <code class="code">nil</code> by default, which means no file
is trusted.  You can customize the variable to be a list of one or more
names of trusted files and directories.  A file name that ends in a
slash <samp class="file">/</samp> is interpreted as a directory, which means all its files
and subdirectories are also trusted.  A special value <code class="code">:all</code> means
<em class="emph">all</em> the files and directories on your system should be trusted;
<strong class="strong">this is not recommended</strong>, as it opens a gaping security hole.
