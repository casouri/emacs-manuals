<p>This hook is used for automatically assigning faces to text in the
buffer.  It is part of the implementation of Jit-Lock mode, used by
Font-Lock.

<dt class="defvr defvar-alias-defvr" id="index-fontification_002dfunctions"><span class="category-def">Variable: </span><span><strong class="def-name">fontification-functions</strong><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-fontification_002dfunctions"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>This variable holds a list of functions that are called by Emacs
redisplay as needed, just before doing redisplay.  They are called even
when Font Lock Mode isn&rsquo;t enabled.  When Font Lock Mode is enabled, this
variable usually holds just one function, <code class="code">jit-lock-function</code>.
</p>
<p>The functions are called in the order listed, with one argument, a
buffer position <var class="var">pos</var>.  Collectively they should attempt to assign
faces to the text in the current buffer starting at <var class="var">pos</var>.
</p>
<p>The functions should record the faces they assign by setting the
<code class="code">face</code> property.  They should also add a non-<code class="code">nil</code>
<code class="code">fontified</code> property to all the text they have assigned faces to.
That property tells redisplay that faces have been assigned to that text
already.
</p>
<p>It is probably a good idea for the functions to do nothing if the
character after <var class="var">pos</var> already has a non-<code class="code">nil</code> <code class="code">fontified</code>
property, but this is not required.  If one function overrides the
assignments made by a previous one, the properties after the last
function finishes are the ones that really matter.
</p>
<p>For efficiency, we recommend writing these functions so that they
usually assign faces to around 400 to 600 characters at each call.
</p>
<p>Note that, when the buffer text includes very long lines, these
functions are called as if they were in a <code class="code">with-restriction</code> form
(see <a class="pxref" href="Narrowing.html">Narrowing</a>), with a
<code class="code">long-line-optimizations-in-fontification-functions</code> label and
with the buffer narrowed to a portion around <var class="var">pos</var>.
