<p>The <kbd class="kbd">q</kbd> command (<code class="code">emerge-quit</code>) finishes the merge, storing
the results into the output file if you specified one.  It restores the
A and B buffers to their proper contents, or kills them if they were
created by Emerge and you haven&rsquo;t changed them.  It also disables the
Emerge commands in the merge buffer, since executing them later could
damage the contents of the various buffers.
</p>
<p><kbd class="kbd">C-]</kbd> aborts the merge.  This means exiting without writing the
output file.  If you didn&rsquo;t specify an output file, then there is no
real difference between aborting and finishing the merge.
</p>
<p>If the Emerge command was called from another Lisp program, then its
return value is <code class="code">t</code> for successful completion, or <code class="code">nil</code> if you
abort.
