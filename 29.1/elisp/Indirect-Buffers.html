<p>An <em class="dfn">indirect buffer</em> shares the text of some other buffer, which
is called the <em class="dfn">base buffer</em> of the indirect buffer.  In some ways it
is the analogue, for buffers, of a symbolic link among files.  The base
buffer may not itself be an indirect buffer.
</p>
<p>The text of the indirect buffer is always identical to the text of its
base buffer; changes made by editing either one are visible immediately
in the other.  This includes the text properties as well as the characters
themselves.
</p>
<p>In all other respects, the indirect buffer and its base buffer are
completely separate.  They have different names, independent values of
point, independent narrowing, independent markers and overlays (though
inserting or deleting text in either buffer relocates the markers and
overlays for both), independent major modes, and independent
buffer-local variable bindings.
</p>
<p>An indirect buffer cannot visit a file, but its base buffer can.  If
you try to save the indirect buffer, that actually saves the base
buffer.
</p>
<p>Killing an indirect buffer has no effect on its base buffer.  Killing
the base buffer effectively kills the indirect buffer in that it cannot
ever again be the current buffer.

<dd><p>This creates and returns an indirect buffer named <var class="var">name</var> whose
base buffer is <var class="var">base-buffer</var>.  The argument <var class="var">base-buffer</var> may
be a live buffer or the name (a string) of an existing buffer.  If
<var class="var">name</var> is the name of an existing buffer, an error is signaled.
</p>
<p>If <var class="var">clone</var> is non-<code class="code">nil</code>, then the indirect buffer originally
shares the state of <var class="var">base-buffer</var> such as major mode, minor
modes, buffer local variables and so on.  If <var class="var">clone</var> is omitted
or <code class="code">nil</code> the indirect buffer&rsquo;s state is set to the default state
for new buffers.
</p>
<p>If <var class="var">base-buffer</var> is an indirect buffer, its base buffer is used as
the base for the new buffer.  If, in addition, <var class="var">clone</var> is
non-<code class="code">nil</code>, the initial state is copied from the actual base
buffer, not from <var class="var">base-buffer</var>.

<p>See <a class="xref" href="Creating-Buffers.html">Creating Buffers</a>, for the meaning of <var class="var">inhibit-buffer-hooks</var>.

<dd><p>This function creates and returns a new indirect buffer that shares
the current buffer&rsquo;s base buffer and copies the rest of the current
buffer&rsquo;s attributes.  (If the current buffer is not indirect, it is
used as the base buffer.)
</p>
<p>If <var class="var">display-flag</var> is non-<code class="code">nil</code>, as it always is in
interactive calls, that means to display the new buffer by calling
<code class="code">pop-to-buffer</code>.  If <var class="var">norecord</var> is non-<code class="code">nil</code>, that means
not to put the new buffer to the front of the buffer list.

<code class="code">nil</code>.  Otherwise, the value is another buffer, which is never an
indirect buffer.
