<p>For those users who live backwards in time, here is information about
downgrading to Emacs version 24.5.  We hope you will enjoy the greater
simplicity that results from the absence of many Emacs 25.1
features.

<h3 class="section"><span>A.1 Old Lisp Features in Emacs 24<a class="copiable-link" href="#Old-Lisp-Features-in-Emacs-24"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>The requirement that <code class="code">setq</code> and <code class="code">setf</code> must be called with
an even number of arguments has been removed.  You can now call them
with an odd number of arguments, and Emacs will helpfully supply a
<code class="code">nil</code> for the missing one.  Simplicity rules!

</li><li><kbd class="kbd">M-x shell</kbd> and <kbd class="kbd">M-x compile</kbd> set the <code class="env">EMACS</code> environment
variable, as they should, to indicate that the subprocess is run by
Emacs.  This is so packages that took years to learn how to work
around that setting could continue using their code to that effect.

</li><li>The <code class="code">save-excursion</code> form saves and restores the mark, as
expected.  No more need for the new <code class="code">save-mark-and-excursion</code>,
which has been deleted.

</li><li>We have removed the <code class="code">text-quoting-style</code> variable and the
associated functionality that translates quote characters in messages
displayed to the user and in help buffers.  Emacs now shows exactly
the same quote characters as you wrote in your code!  Likewise,
<code class="code">substitute-command-keys</code> leaves the quote characters alone.  As
you move back in time, Unicode support becomes less and less
important, so no need to display those fancy new quotes the Unicode
Standard invented.

</li><li>Regular expressions have been simplified by removing support for
Unicode character properties in regexp classes.  As result,
<code class="code">[:alpha:]</code> and <code class="code">[:alnum:]</code> will match any character with a
word syntax, and <code class="code">[:graph:]</code> and <code class="code">[:print:]</code> will match any
multibyte character, including surrogates and unassigned codepoints.
Once again, this is in line with diminishing importance of Unicode as
you move back in time.

</li><li>Evaluating &lsquo;<samp class="samp">(/ <var class="var">n</var>)</samp>&rsquo; will now yield <var class="var">n</var>.  We have
realized that interpreting that as in Common Lisp was a bad mistake
that needed to be corrected.

</li><li>The <code class="code">pcase</code> form was significantly simplified by removing the
UPatterns <code class="code">quote</code> and <code class="code">app</code>.  To further simplify this
facility, we&rsquo;ve removed <code class="code">pcase-defmacro</code>, since we found no need
for letting Lisp programs define new UPatterns.

</li><li>We&rsquo;ve removed the text properties <code class="code">cursor-intangible</code> and
<code class="code">cursor-sensor-functions</code>, replacing them by the much simpler
<code class="code">intangible</code>, <code class="code">point-entered</code>, and <code class="code">point-left</code>
properties.  The latter are implemented on a much lower level, and
therefore are better integrated with user expectations.  For similar
reasons, <code class="code">cursor-intangible-mode</code> and <code class="code">cursor-sensor-mode</code>
were removed; use the hook variable <code class="code">inhibit-point-motion-hooks</code>
which is no longer obsolete.

</li><li>Process creation and management functions were significantly improved
and simplified by removing <code class="code">make-process</code> and the <code class="code">pipe</code>
connection type.  Redirecting <code class="code">stderr</code> of a subprocess should be
done with shell facilities, not by Emacs.

</li><li>We decided that shutting up informative messages is bad for user
interaction, so we&rsquo;ve removed the <code class="code">inhibit-message</code> variable
which could be used to that effect.

</li><li>Support for generators and for finalizers has been removed, as we
found no real need for these facilities.

</li><li>Due to excessive complexity and the diminishing need for Unicode
support, the functions <code class="code">string-collate-lessp</code> and
<code class="code">string-collate-equalp</code> were removed.  Their locale-independent
counterparts <code class="code">string-lessp</code> and <code class="code">string-equal</code> are so much
more simple and yield predictable results that we don&rsquo;t see any
situation where the locale-dependent collation could be useful in
Emacs.  As result, the <samp class="file">ls-lisp.el</samp> package sorts files in a
locale-independent manner.

</li><li>In preparation for removal in some past version of Emacs of the
bidirectional editing support, we started by deleting two functions
<code class="code">bidi-find-overridden-directionality</code> and
<code class="code">buffer-substring-with-bidi-context</code>.

</li><li>Time conversion functions, such as <code class="code">current-time-string</code>, no
longer accept an optional <var class="var">zone</var> argument.  If you need to change
the current time zone (why?), do that explicitly with
<code class="code">set-time-zone-rule</code>.

</li><li>As part of the ongoing quest for simplicity, many other functions and
variables have been eliminated.
