<p>A character is a Lisp object which represents a single character of
text.  In Emacs Lisp, characters are simply integers; whether an
integer is a character or not is determined only by how it is used.
See <a class="xref" href="Character-Codes.html">Character Codes</a>, for details about character representation in
Emacs.
</p>
<p>A string is a fixed sequence of characters.  It is a type of
sequence called a <em class="dfn">array</em>, meaning that its length is fixed and
cannot be altered once it is created (see <a class="pxref" href="Sequences-Arrays-Vectors.html">Sequences, Arrays, and Vectors</a>).  Unlike in C, Emacs Lisp strings are <em class="emph">not</em> terminated
by a distinguished character code.
</p>
<p>Since strings are arrays, and therefore sequences as well, you can
operate on them with the general array and sequence functions documented
in <a class="ref" href="Sequences-Arrays-Vectors.html">Sequences, Arrays, and Vectors</a>.  For example, you can access or
change individual characters in a string using the functions <code class="code">aref</code>
and <code class="code">aset</code> (see <a class="pxref" href="Array-Functions.html">Functions that Operate on Arrays</a>).  However, note that
<code class="code">length</code> should <em class="emph">not</em> be used for computing the width of a
string on display; use <code class="code">string-width</code> (see <a class="pxref" href="Size-of-Displayed-Text.html">Size of Displayed Text</a>) instead.
</p>
<p>There are two text representations for non-<abbr class="acronym">ASCII</abbr>
characters in Emacs strings (and in buffers): unibyte and multibyte.
For most Lisp programming, you don&rsquo;t need to be concerned with these
two representations.  See <a class="xref" href="Text-Representations.html">Text Representations</a>, for details.
</p>
<p>Sometimes key sequences are represented as unibyte strings.  When a
unibyte string is a key sequence, string elements in the range 128 to
255 represent meta characters (which are large integers) rather than
character codes in the range 128 to 255.  Strings cannot hold
characters that have the hyper, super or alt modifiers; they can hold
<abbr class="acronym">ASCII</abbr> control characters, but no other control characters.
They do not distinguish case in <abbr class="acronym">ASCII</abbr> control characters.
If you want to store such characters in a sequence, such as a key
sequence, you must use a vector instead of a string.  See <a class="xref" href="Character-Type.html">Character Type</a>, for more information about keyboard input characters.
</p>
<p>Strings are useful for holding regular expressions.  You can also
match regular expressions against strings with <code class="code">string-match</code>
(see <a class="pxref" href="Regexp-Search.html">Regular Expression Searching</a>).  The functions <code class="code">match-string</code>
(see <a class="pxref" href="Simple-Match-Data.html">Simple Match Data Access</a>) and <code class="code">replace-match</code> (see <a class="pxref" href="Replacing-Match.html">Replacing the Text that Matched</a>) are useful for decomposing and modifying strings after
matching regular expressions against them.
</p>
<p>Like a buffer, a string can contain text properties for the characters
in it, as well as the characters themselves.  See <a class="xref" href="Text-Properties.html">Text Properties</a>.
All the Lisp primitives that copy text from strings to buffers or other
strings also copy the properties of the characters being copied.
</p>
<p>See <a class="xref" href="Text.html">Text</a>, for information about functions that display strings or
copy them into buffers.  See <a class="xref" href="Character-Type.html">Character Type</a>, and <a class="ref" href="String-Type.html">String Type</a>,
for information about the syntax of characters and strings.
See <a class="xref" href="Non_002dASCII-Characters.html">Non-<abbr class="acronym">ASCII</abbr> Characters</a>, for functions to convert between text
representations and to encode and decode character codes.
