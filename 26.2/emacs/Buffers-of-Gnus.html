<p>Gnus uses several buffers to display information and to receive
commands.  The three most commonly-used Gnus buffers are the
<em class="dfn">group buffer</em>, the <em class="dfn">summary buffer</em> and the <em class="dfn">article
buffer</em>.
</p>
<p>The <em class="dfn">group buffer</em> contains a list of article sources (e.g.,
newsgroups and email inboxes), which are collectively referred to as
<em class="dfn">groups</em>.  This is the first buffer Gnus displays when it starts
up.  It normally displays only the groups to which you subscribe and
that contain unread articles.  From this buffer, you can select a
group to read.
</p>
<p>The <em class="dfn">summary buffer</em> lists the articles in a single group,
showing one article per line.  By default, it displays each article&rsquo;s
author, subject, and line
number, but this is customizable; See <a data-manual="gnus" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/gnus/Summary-Buffer-Format.html#Summary-Buffer-Format">Summary Buffer Format</a> in <cite class="cite">The Gnus Manual</cite>.
The summary buffer is created when you select a group in the group
buffer, and is killed when you exit the group.
</p>
<p>From the summary buffer, you can choose an article to view.  The
article is displayed in the <em class="dfn">article buffer</em>.  In normal Gnus
usage, you view this buffer but do not select it&mdash;all useful Gnus
commands can be invoked from the summary buffer.  But you can select
the article buffer, and execute Gnus commands from it, if you wish.
