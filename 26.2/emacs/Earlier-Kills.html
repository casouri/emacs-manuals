<h4 class="subsection" id="Yanking-Earlier-Kills"><span>12.2.2 Yanking Earlier Kills<a class="copiable-link" href="#Yanking-Earlier-Kills"> &para;</a></span></h4>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-yanking-previous-kills"></a>

<p>As explained in <a class="ref" href="Yanking.html">Yanking</a>, you can use a numeric argument to
<kbd class="kbd">C-y</kbd> to yank text that is no longer the most recent kill.  This
is useful if you remember which kill ring entry you want.  If you
don&rsquo;t, you can use the <kbd class="kbd">M-y</kbd> (<code class="code">yank-pop</code>) command to cycle
through the possibilities.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-M_002dy"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-yank_002dpop"></a>
<p>If the previous command was a yank command, <kbd class="kbd">M-y</kbd> takes the text
that was yanked and replaces it with the text from an earlier kill.
So, to recover the text of the next-to-the-last kill, first use
<kbd class="kbd">C-y</kbd> to yank the last kill, and then use <kbd class="kbd">M-y</kbd> to replace it
with the previous kill.  <kbd class="kbd">M-y</kbd> is allowed only after a <kbd class="kbd">C-y</kbd>
or another <kbd class="kbd">M-y</kbd>.
</p>
<p>You can understand <kbd class="kbd">M-y</kbd> in terms of a last-yank pointer which
points at an entry in the kill ring.  Each time you kill, the last-yank
pointer moves to the newly made entry at the front of the ring.
<kbd class="kbd">C-y</kbd> yanks the entry which the last-yank pointer points to.
<kbd class="kbd">M-y</kbd> moves the last-yank pointer to a different entry, and the
text in the buffer changes to match.  Enough <kbd class="kbd">M-y</kbd> commands can move
the pointer to any entry in the ring, so you can get any entry into the
buffer.  Eventually the pointer reaches the end of the ring; the next
<kbd class="kbd">M-y</kbd> loops back around to the first entry again.
</p>
<p><kbd class="kbd">M-y</kbd> moves the last-yank pointer around the ring, but it does
not change the order of the entries in the ring, which always runs from
the most recent kill at the front to the oldest one still remembered.
</p>
<p><kbd class="kbd">M-y</kbd> can take a numeric argument, which tells it how many entries
to advance the last-yank pointer by.  A negative argument moves the
pointer toward the front of the ring; from the front of the ring, it
moves around to the last entry and continues forward from there.
</p>
<p>Once the text you are looking for is brought into the buffer, you can
stop doing <kbd class="kbd">M-y</kbd> commands and it will stay there.  It&rsquo;s just a copy
of the kill ring entry, so editing it in the buffer does not change
what&rsquo;s in the ring.  As long as no new killing is done, the last-yank
pointer remains at the same place in the kill ring, so repeating
<kbd class="kbd">C-y</kbd> will yank another copy of the same previous kill.
</p>
<p>When you call <kbd class="kbd">C-y</kbd> with a numeric argument, that also sets the
last-yank pointer to the entry that it yanks.
