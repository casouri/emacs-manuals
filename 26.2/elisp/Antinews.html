<p>For those users who live backwards in time, here is information about
downgrading to Emacs version 25.3.  We hope you will enjoy the greater
simplicity that results from the absence of many Emacs&nbsp;26.2<!-- /@w --> features.
</p>
<ul class="mini-toc">

<h3 class="section"><span>A.1 Old Lisp Features in Emacs 25<a class="copiable-link" href="#Old-Lisp-Features-in-Emacs-25"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>The concurrency features have been removed.  Even in its limited
&ldquo;mostly cooperative&rdquo; form, with only one Lisp thread running at any
given time, it made Emacs significantly more complex for Lisp programs
that need to work correctly in the presence of additional threads.

</li><li>Handling of file attributes has been simplified by discarding the
accessor functions, such as <code class="code">file-attribute-type</code> and
<code class="code">file-attribute-modification-time</code>.  Real Lisp programmers always
access the individual attributes by their ordinal numbers, and can
recite those numbers in their sleep.

</li><li>The networking code is back at its pristine simplicity, as we deleted
the use of asynchronous DNS resolution, connection, and TLS
negotiation for TLS streams.  You no longer need to consider the
resulting complexity and interesting race conditions when you write
Lisp programs that use network communications.  As a direct
consequence, the <code class="code">:complete-negotiation</code> parameter of
<code class="code">gnutls-boot</code> has become unnecessary, and was removed&mdash;just one
example of how removal of asynchronicity simplifies Emacs.

</li><li>We&rsquo;ve removed the <samp class="file">puny.el</samp> library, so Web sites with
non-<abbr class="acronym">ASCII</abbr> URLs are no longer easily accessible.  But such
sites become more and more rare as you move back in time, so having a
specialized library for their support was deemed an unnecessary
maintenance burden.

</li><li>The time conversion functions <code class="code">current-time-string</code>,
<code class="code">current-time-zone</code>, <code class="code">decode-time</code>,
<code class="code">format-time-string</code>, and <code class="code">set-time-zone-rule</code> no longer
accept integer offsets as time zone rules, to make it more of a
challenge to convert foreign timestamps.  Also,
<code class="code">format-time-string</code> no longer converts &lsquo;<samp class="samp">%q</samp>&rsquo; to the calendar
quarter, as that is something you can easily do for yourself.

</li><li>Field numbers like &lsquo;<samp class="samp">%2$</samp>&rsquo; in format specifiers are no longer
available.  We decided that their use makes code reading and
comprehension much harder, and that having them is unjustified in the
past where similar features in popular C libraries will also be gone.

</li><li>Since the built-in capability to display line numbers has been removed
(see <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Antinews.html#Antinews">Antinews</a> in <cite class="cite">The GNU Emacs Manual</cite>), we&rsquo;ve also deleted
the <code class="code">line-number-display-width</code> function and the support for the
<code class="code">display-line-numbers-disable</code> property, as Lisp programs that do
their own display layout decisions no longer need to cater to this
tricky feature.

</li><li>Regular expressions have been simplified by removing support for
Unicode character properties in the <code class="code">[:blank:]</code> regexp class.  As
result, this class will match only spaces and tabs.  Once again, this
is in line with diminishing importance of Unicode as you move back in
time.

</li><li>For similar reasons, we removed the function <code class="code">char-from-name</code>.
It should be easy enough to access the full list of Unicode characters
returned by <code class="code">ucs-names</code> instead, for as long as Unicode support
in Emacs exists (which shouldn&rsquo;t be too long).

</li><li>Various functions that accept file names as arguments, such as
<code class="code">file-attributes</code>, <code class="code">file-symlink-p</code>, and
<code class="code">make-symbolic-link</code> gained back the special support for file
names quoted with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">/:</samp>&rsquo;, and they now interpret &lsquo;<samp class="samp">~</samp>&rsquo; in
symlink targets as you&rsquo;d expect: to mean your home directory.  The
confusing differences between the operation of these functions in
interactive and non-interactive invocations has been removed.

</li><li>Several functions that create or rename their files now treat their
destination specially if it happens to be a directory, even when its
name does not appear to be that of a directory.  For example,
<code class="code">(rename-file &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot;)</code> no longer renames <samp class="file">A</samp> to <samp class="file">B</samp> if
<samp class="file">B</samp> happens to be a directory.  This is so that dealing with
files becomes more of an adventure.

</li><li>The <code class="code">format</code> function now returns new strings in more cases, to
place more stress on the Emacs memory manager and thereby test Emacs
better.

</li><li>The function <samp class="file">assoc</samp> has been simplified by removing its third
optional argument.  It now always uses <code class="code">equal</code> for comparison.
Likewise, <code class="code">alist-get</code> always uses <code class="code">assq</code>, and <code class="code">map-get</code>
and <code class="code">map-put</code> always use <code class="code">eql</code> for their comparisons.

</li><li>Numeric comparisons and the functions <code class="code">format</code>,
<code class="code">make-hash-table</code>, <code class="code">min</code>, <code class="code">max</code> and <code class="code">logb</code> now
occasionally round values internally to make their results less
predictable.

</li><li>The functions <code class="code">ffloor</code>, <code class="code">fceiling</code>l, <code class="code">ftruncate</code> and
<code class="code">fround</code> now accept integer arguments.  Conversely, functions
like <code class="code">decode-char</code> that accept floating-point integers now accept
arguments that are not integers.  In both cases the results are
amusingly nonsensical sometimes.

</li><li>GnuTLS cryptographic functions are no longer available in Emacs.  We
have decided that the needs for such functionality are deteriorating,
and their cumbersome interfaces make them hard to use.

</li><li>We have removed support for records of user-defined types, and
<code class="code">cl-defstruct</code> no longer uses records.  This removes the
potential for quite a few places where existing and past code could be
broken by records.

</li><li>You can again use <code class="code">string-as-unibyte</code>,
<code class="code">string-make-multibyte</code>, and other similar functions, without
being annoyed by messages about their deprecation.  This is in
preparation for removal of multibyte text from Emacs in the distant
past.

</li><li>The <code class="code">string-version-lessp</code> function has been removed, to
encourage programmers to use their own idiosyncratic methods to
determine whether one version string precedes another.

</li><li>The function <code class="code">read-color</code> no longer displays color names using
each color as the background.  We have determined that this surprises
users and produces funny inconsistent results on color-challenged
terminals.

</li><li>Support for 24-bit color on text terminals has been dropped, since
it wasn&rsquo;t needed long ago.

</li><li>We removed the function <code class="code">file-name-case-insensitive-p</code>, as
testing for the OS symbol should be enough for the observable past to
come, and learning to use yet another API is a burden.

</li><li>The function <code class="code">read-multiple-choice</code> is also gone, in recognition
of the fact that nothing makes Emacs Lisp hackers rejoice more than
the need to sit down and write yet another interactive
question-and-answer function, and make it optimal for each specific
case.

</li><li>The function <code class="code">add-variable-watcher</code> and the corresponding
debugger command <code class="code">debug-on-variable-change</code> have been removed.
They make debugging more complicated, while examining the value of a
variable at each stop point is easy enough to cover the same use
cases.  Let simplicity rule!

</li><li>The function <code class="code">mapcan</code> is gone; use <code class="code">mapcar</code> instead, and
process the resulting list as you see fit.

</li><li>Low-level list functions like <code class="code">length</code> and <code class="code">member</code> can now
loop indefinitely when given cyclic lists, causing Emacs to freeze.
This can help these functions run a tiny bit faster in the usual case
where the input is not cyclic.

</li><li>The <code class="code">write-region</code> function no longer propagates its
<var class="var">lockname</var> argument to file name handlers.

</li><li>You can once again write a Lisp program that returns funny random
values from <code class="code">file-attributes</code> by having another process alter the
filesystem while Emacs is accessing the file.  This can give rise to
some interesting applications in the near past.

</li><li>The functions <code class="code">file-attributes</code>, <code class="code">file-symlink-p</code>, and
<code class="code">make-symbolic-link</code> now quietly mutate the target of a local
symbolic link in some cases, to make it more of a challenge to deal
with arbitrary symlinks in Emacs code.

</li><li>The error <code class="code">file-missing</code> has been removed; operations now lump
such errors into the <code class="code">file-error</code> category instead.

</li><li>The function <code class="code">delete-directory</code> now signals an error if operating
recursively and some other process deletes the directory before this
function gets to it.

</li><li>The <code class="code">dutch</code> input method now attempts to support Turkish too,
albeit incorrectly.  Also, it converts &lsquo;<samp class="samp">IJ</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">ij</samp>&rsquo; to
special characters instead of leaving them alone.

</li><li>Non-breaking hyphens and approximations to quotes are now displayed
just with the <code class="code">escape-glyph</code> face instead of having faces of
their own.  This is simpler and gives the user amusing puzzles to
solve when viewing text containing these characters.

</li><li>The user option <code class="code">electric-quote-context-sensitive</code> and the
variable <code class="code">electric-quote-inhibit-functions</code>, so that electric
quoting is simpler and more likely to do the wrong thing.

</li><li>The user option <code class="code">text-quoting-style</code> has been removed, and is now
just a variable.

</li><li>We have removed the functions <code class="code">file-name-quote</code>,
<code class="code">file-name-unquote</code>, and <code class="code">file-name-quoted-p</code>.  Writing code
that checks whether a file name is already quoted is easy, and doubly
quoting a file name should not produce any problems for well-written
Lisp code.

</li><li>Frame parameters like <code class="code">z-group</code>, <code class="code">min-width</code>,
<code class="code">parent-frame</code>, <code class="code">delete-before</code>, etc. have been removed.
Emacs should not replace your window-manager, certainly not as
window-managers become less and less capable.

</li><li>We decided that the format of mode line and header line should be
customizable only based on buffers; the <code class="code">mode-line-format</code> and
<code class="code">header-line-format</code> window parameters have been removed.

</li><li>Emacs now normally builds a limited <code class="command">movemail</code> substitute that
retrieves POP3 email only via insecure channels, and the
configure-time option <samp class="option">--with-mailutils</samp> has been removed.
This simplifies Emacs setup when security is not important.

</li><li>The configure-time option <samp class="option">--enable-gcc-warnings=warn-only</samp>
has been removed, so that build-time warnings are always fatal now.

</li><li>The configure-time option <samp class="option">--disable-build-details</samp> has been
removed.  This way, Emacs builds are unique and irreproducible.

</li><li>The variable <code class="code">emacs-version</code> now includes the build number
instead of storing it separately in <code class="code">emacs-build-number</code>.

</li><li>Emacs has been ported to IRIX.

</li><li>Several options and variables have been removed to simplify Emacs and
potentially make it less reliable.  These include the
<samp class="option">--module-assertions</samp> option, the
<code class="code">attempt-stack-overflow-recovery</code> variable, and the
<code class="code">attempt-orderly-shutdown-on-fatal-signal</code> variable.

</li><li>As part of the ongoing quest for simplicity, many other functions and
variables have been eliminated.
