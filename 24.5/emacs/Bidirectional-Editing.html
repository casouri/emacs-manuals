<p>Emacs supports editing text written in scripts, such as Arabic and
Hebrew, whose natural ordering of horizontal text for display is from
right to left.  However, digits and Latin text embedded in these
scripts are still displayed left to right.  It is also not uncommon to
have small portions of text in Arabic or Hebrew embedded in an otherwise
Latin document; e.g., as comments and strings in a program source
file.  For these reasons, text that uses these scripts is actually
<em class="dfn">bidirectional</em>: a mixture of runs of left-to-right and
right-to-left characters.
</p>
<p>This section describes the facilities and options provided by Emacs
for editing bidirectional text.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-logical-order"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-visual-order"></a>
<p>Emacs stores right-to-left and bidirectional text in the so-called
<em class="dfn">logical</em> (or <em class="dfn">reading</em>) order: the buffer or string position
of the first character you read precedes that of the next character.
Reordering of bidirectional text into the <em class="dfn">visual</em> order happens
at display time.  As result, character positions no longer increase
monotonically with their positions on display.  Emacs implements the
Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm described in the Unicode Standard
Annex #9, for reordering of bidirectional text for display.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-bidi_002ddisplay_002dreordering"></a>
<p>The buffer-local variable <code class="code">bidi-display-reordering</code> controls
whether text in the buffer is reordered for display.  If its value is
non-<code class="code">nil</code>, Emacs reorders characters that have right-to-left
directionality when they are displayed.  The default value is
<code class="code">t</code>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-base-direction-of-paragraphs"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-paragraph_002c-base-direction"></a>
<p>Each paragraph of bidirectional text can have its own <em class="dfn">base
direction</em>, either right-to-left or left-to-right.  (Paragraph
boundaries are empty lines, i.e., lines consisting entirely of
whitespace characters.)  Text in left-to-right paragraphs begins on
the screen at the left margin of the window and is truncated or
continued when it reaches the right margin.  By contrast, text in
right-to-left paragraphs is displayed starting at the right margin and
is continued or truncated at the left margin.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-bidi_002dparagraph_002ddirection"></a>
<p>Emacs determines the base direction of each paragraph dynamically,
based on the text at the beginning of the paragraph.  However,
sometimes a buffer may need to force a certain base direction for its
paragraphs.  The variable <code class="code">bidi-paragraph-direction</code>, if
non-<code class="code">nil</code>, disables the dynamic determination of the base
direction, and instead forces all paragraphs in the buffer to have the
direction specified by its buffer-local value.  The value can be either
<code class="code">right-to-left</code> or <code class="code">left-to-right</code>.  Any other value is
interpreted as <code class="code">nil</code>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-LRM"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-RLM"></a>
<p>Alternatively, you can control the base direction of a paragraph by
inserting special formatting characters in front of the paragraph.
The special character <code class="code">RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK</code>, or <small class="sc">RLM</small>, forces
the right-to-left direction on the following paragraph, while
<code class="code">LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK</code>, or <small class="sc">LRM</small> forces the left-to-right
direction.  (You can use <kbd class="kbd">C-x 8 <kbd class="key">RET</kbd></kbd> to insert these characters.)
In a GUI session, the <small class="sc">LRM</small> and <small class="sc">RLM</small> characters display as very
thin blank characters; on text terminals they display as blanks.
</p>
<p>Because characters are reordered for display, Emacs commands that
operate in the logical order or on stretches of buffer positions may
produce unusual effects.  For example, <kbd class="kbd">C-f</kbd> and <kbd class="kbd">C-b</kbd>
commands move point in the logical order, so the cursor will sometimes
jump when point traverses reordered bidirectional text.  Similarly, a
highlighted region covering a contiguous range of character positions
may look discontinuous if the region spans reordered text.  This is
normal and similar to the behavior of other programs that support
bidirectional text.  If you set <code class="code">visual-order-cursor-movement</code> to
a non-<code class="code">nil</code> value, cursor motion by the arrow keys follows the
visual order on screen (see <a class="pxref" href="Moving-Point.html">visual-order movement</a>).
