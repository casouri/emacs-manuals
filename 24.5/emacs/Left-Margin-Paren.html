<h4 class="subsection" id="Left-Margin-Convention"><span>26.2.1 Left Margin Convention<a class="copiable-link" href="#Left-Margin-Convention"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-open_002dparenthesis-in-leftmost-column"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-_0028-in-leftmost-column"></a>
<p>Many programming-language modes assume by default that any opening
delimiter found at the left margin is the start of a top-level
definition, or defun.  Therefore, <strong class="strong">don&rsquo;t put an opening
delimiter at the left margin unless it should have that significance</strong>.
For instance, never put an open-parenthesis at the left margin in a
Lisp file unless it is the start of a top-level list.
</p>
<p>The convention speeds up many Emacs operations, which would
otherwise have to scan back to the beginning of the buffer to analyze
the syntax of the code.
</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t follow this convention, not only will you have trouble
when you explicitly use the commands for motion by defuns; other
features that use them will also give you trouble.  This includes the
indentation commands (see <a class="pxref" href="Program-Indent.html">Indentation for Programs</a>) and Font Lock mode
(see <a class="pxref" href="Font-Lock.html">Font Lock mode</a>).
</p>
<p>The most likely problem case is when you want an opening delimiter
at the start of a line inside a string.  To avoid trouble, put an
escape character (&lsquo;<samp class="samp">\</samp>&rsquo;, in C and Emacs Lisp, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">/</samp>&rsquo; in some
other Lisp dialects) before the opening delimiter.  This will not
affect the contents of the string, but will prevent that opening
delimiter from starting a defun.  Here&rsquo;s an example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">  (insert &quot;Foo:
\(bar)
&quot;)
</pre></div>

<p>To help you catch violations of this convention, Font Lock mode
highlights confusing opening delimiters (those that ought to be
quoted) in bold red.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-open_002dparen_002din_002dcolumn_002d0_002dis_002ddefun_002dstart"></a>
<p>If you need to override this convention, you can do so by setting
the variable <code class="code">open-paren-in-column-0-is-defun-start</code>.
If this user option is set to <code class="code">t</code> (the default), opening
parentheses or braces at column zero always start defuns.  When it is
<code class="code">nil</code>, defuns are found by searching for parens or braces at the
outermost level.
</p>
<p>Usually, you should leave this option at its default value of
<code class="code">t</code>.  If your buffer contains parentheses or braces in column
zero which don&rsquo;t start defuns, and it is somehow impractical to remove
these parentheses or braces, it might be helpful to set the option to
<code class="code">nil</code>.  Be aware that this might make scrolling and display in
large buffers quite sluggish.  Furthermore, the parentheses and braces
must be correctly matched throughout the buffer for it to work
properly.
