<a name="Garbage-Collection-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">E.3 Garbage Collection</h3>

<a name="index-memory-allocation"></a>
<p>When a program creates a list or the user defines a new function
(such as by loading a library), that data is placed in normal storage.
If normal storage runs low, then Emacs asks the operating system to
allocate more memory.  Different types of Lisp objects, such as
symbols, cons cells, small vectors, markers, etc., are segregated in
distinct blocks in memory.  (Large vectors, long strings, buffers and
certain other editing types, which are fairly large, are allocated in
individual blocks, one per object; small strings are packed into blocks
of 8k bytes, and small vectors are packed into blocks of 4k bytes).
</p>
<a name="index-vector_002dlike-objects_002c-storage"></a>
<a name="index-storage-of-vector_002dlike-Lisp-objects"></a>
<p>Beyond the basic vector, a lot of objects like window, buffer, and
frame are managed as if they were vectors.  The corresponding C data
structures include the <code>struct vectorlike_header</code> field whose
<code>next</code> field points to the next object in the chain:
<code>header.next.buffer</code> points to the next buffer (which could be
a killed buffer), and <code>header.next.vector</code> points to the next
vector in a free list.  If a vector is small (smaller than or equal to
<code>VBLOCK_BYTES_MAX</code> bytes, see <samp>alloc.c</samp>), then
<code>header.next.nbytes</code> contains the vector size in bytes.
</p>
<a name="index-garbage-collection"></a>
<p>It is quite common to use some storage for a while, then release it
by (for example) killing a buffer or deleting the last pointer to an
object.  Emacs provides a <em>garbage collector</em> to reclaim this
abandoned storage.  The garbage collector operates by finding and
marking all Lisp objects that are still accessible to Lisp programs.
To begin with, it assumes all the symbols, their values and associated
function definitions, and any data presently on the stack, are
accessible.  Any objects that can be reached indirectly through other
accessible objects are also accessible.
</p>
<p>When marking is finished, all objects still unmarked are garbage.  No
matter what the Lisp program or the user does, it is impossible to refer
to them, since there is no longer a way to reach them.  Their space
might as well be reused, since no one will miss them.  The second
(&ldquo;sweep&rdquo;) phase of the garbage collector arranges to reuse them.
</p>

<a name="index-free-list"></a>
<p>The sweep phase puts unused cons cells onto a <em>free list</em>
for future allocation; likewise for symbols and markers.  It compacts
the accessible strings so they occupy fewer 8k blocks; then it frees the
other 8k blocks.  Unreachable vectors from vector blocks are coalesced
to create largest possible free areas; if a free area spans a complete
4k block, that block is freed.  Otherwise, the free area is recorded
in a free list array, where each entry corresponds to a free list
of areas of the same size.  Large vectors, buffers, and other large
objects are allocated and freed individually.
</p>
<a name="index-CL-note_002d_002d_002dallocate-more-storage"></a>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Common Lisp note:</b> Unlike other Lisps, GNU Emacs Lisp does not
call the garbage collector when the free list is empty.  Instead, it
simply requests the operating system to allocate more storage, and
processing continues until <code>gc-cons-threshold</code> bytes have been
used.
</p>
<p>This means that you can make sure that the garbage collector will not
run during a certain portion of a Lisp program by calling the garbage
collector explicitly just before it (provided that portion of the
program does not use so much space as to force a second garbage
collection).
</p></blockquote>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-garbage_002dcollect"></a>Command: <strong>garbage-collect</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This command runs a garbage collection, and returns information on
the amount of space in use.  (Garbage collection can also occur
spontaneously if you use more than <code>gc-cons-threshold</code> bytes of
Lisp data since the previous garbage collection.)
</p>
<p><code>garbage-collect</code> returns a list containing the following
information:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">((<var>used-conses</var> . <var>free-conses</var>)
 (<var>used-syms</var> . <var>free-syms</var>)
</pre><pre class="example"> (<var>used-miscs</var> . <var>free-miscs</var>)
 <var>used-string-chars</var>
 <var>used-vector-slots</var>
 (<var>used-floats</var> . <var>free-floats</var>)
 (<var>used-intervals</var> . <var>free-intervals</var>)
 (<var>used-strings</var> . <var>free-strings</var>))
</pre></div>

<p>Here is an example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(garbage-collect)
     &rArr; ((106886 . 13184) (9769 . 0)
                (7731 . 4651) 347543 121628
                (31 . 94) (1273 . 168)
                (25474 . 3569))
</pre></div>

<p>Here is a table explaining each element:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><var>used-conses</var></dt>
<dd><p>The number of cons cells in use.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>free-conses</var></dt>
<dd><p>The number of cons cells for which space has been obtained from the
operating system, but that are not currently being used.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>used-syms</var></dt>
<dd><p>The number of symbols in use.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>free-syms</var></dt>

</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>used-miscs</var></dt>
<dd><p>The number of miscellaneous objects in use.  These include markers and
overlays, plus certain objects not visible to users.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>free-miscs</var></dt>
<dd><p>The number of miscellaneous objects for which space has been obtained
from the operating system, but that are not currently being used.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>used-string-chars</var></dt>
<dd><p>The total size of all strings, in characters.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>used-vector-slots</var></dt>
<dd><p>The total number of elements of existing vectors.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>used-floats</var></dt>
<dd><p>The number of floats in use.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>free-floats</var></dt>
<dd><p>The number of floats for which space has been obtained from the
operating system, but that are not currently being used.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>used-intervals</var></dt>
<dd><p>The number of intervals in use.  Intervals are an internal
data structure used for representing text properties.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>free-intervals</var></dt>
<dd><p>The number of intervals for which space has been obtained
from the operating system, but that are not currently being used.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>used-strings</var></dt>
<dd><p>The number of strings in use.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>free-strings</var></dt>
<dd><p>The number of string headers for which the space was obtained from the
operating system, but which are currently not in use.  (A string
object consists of a header and the storage for the string text
itself; the latter is only allocated when the string is created.)
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>If there was overflow in pure space (see <a href="Pure-Storage.html#Pure-Storage">Pure Storage</a>),
<code>garbage-collect</code> returns <code>nil</code>, because a real garbage
collection cannot be done.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-garbage_002dcollection_002dmessages"></a>User Option: <strong>garbage-collection-messages</strong></dt>
<dd><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, Emacs displays a message at the
beginning and end of garbage collection.  The default value is
<code>nil</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-post_002dgc_002dhook"></a>Variable: <strong>post-gc-hook</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This is a normal hook that is run at the end of garbage collection.
Garbage collection is inhibited while the hook functions run, so be
careful writing them.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-gc_002dcons_002dthreshold"></a>User Option: <strong>gc-cons-threshold</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The value of this variable is the number of bytes of storage that must
be allocated for Lisp objects after one garbage collection in order to
trigger another garbage collection.  A cons cell counts as eight bytes,
a string as one byte per character plus a few bytes of overhead, and so
on; space allocated to the contents of buffers does not count.  Note
that the subsequent garbage collection does not happen immediately when
the threshold is exhausted, but only the next time the Lisp evaluator is
called.
</p>
<p>The initial threshold value is 800,000.  If you specify a larger
value, garbage collection will happen less often.  This reduces the
amount of time spent garbage collecting, but increases total memory use.
You may want to do this when running a program that creates lots of
Lisp data.
</p>
<p>You can make collections more frequent by specifying a smaller value,
down to 10,000.  A value less than 10,000 will remain in effect only
until the subsequent garbage collection, at which time
<code>garbage-collect</code> will set the threshold back to 10,000.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-gc_002dcons_002dpercentage"></a>User Option: <strong>gc-cons-percentage</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The value of this variable specifies the amount of consing before a
garbage collection occurs, as a fraction of the current heap size.
This criterion and <code>gc-cons-threshold</code> apply in parallel, and
garbage collection occurs only when both criteria are satisfied.
</p>
<p>As the heap size increases, the time to perform a garbage collection
increases.  Thus, it can be desirable to do them less frequently in
proportion.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>The value returned by <code>garbage-collect</code> describes the amount of
memory used by Lisp data, broken down by data type.  By contrast, the
function <code>memory-limit</code> provides information on the total amount of
memory Emacs is currently using.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-memory_002dlimit"></a>Function: <strong>memory-limit</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns the address of the last byte Emacs has allocated,
divided by 1024.  We divide the value by 1024 to make sure it fits in a
Lisp integer.
</p>
<p>You can use this to get a general idea of how your actions affect the
memory usage.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-memory_002dfull"></a>Variable: <strong>memory-full</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This variable is <code>t</code> if Emacs is nearly out of memory for Lisp
objects, and <code>nil</code> otherwise.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-memory_002duse_002dcounts"></a>Function: <strong>memory-use-counts</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This returns a list of numbers that count the number of objects
created in this Emacs session.  Each of these counters increments for
a certain kind of object.  See the documentation string for details.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-gcs_002ddone"></a>Variable: <strong>gcs-done</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This variable contains the total number of garbage collections
done so far in this Emacs session.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-gc_002delapsed"></a>Variable: <strong>gc-elapsed</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This variable contains the total number of seconds of elapsed time
during garbage collection so far in this Emacs session, as a floating
point number.
</p></dd></dl>
