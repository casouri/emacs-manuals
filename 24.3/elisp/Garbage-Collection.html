<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-memory-allocation"></a>
<p>When a program creates a list or the user defines a new function
(such as by loading a library), that data is placed in normal storage.
If normal storage runs low, then Emacs asks the operating system to
allocate more memory.  Different types of Lisp objects, such as
symbols, cons cells, small vectors, markers, etc., are segregated in
distinct blocks in memory.  (Large vectors, long strings, buffers and
certain other editing types, which are fairly large, are allocated in
individual blocks, one per object; small strings are packed into blocks
of 8k bytes, and small vectors are packed into blocks of 4k bytes).
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-vector_002dlike-objects_002c-storage"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-storage-of-vector_002dlike-Lisp-objects"></a>
<p>Beyond the basic vector, a lot of objects like window, buffer, and
frame are managed as if they were vectors.  The corresponding C data
structures include the <code class="code">struct vectorlike_header</code> field whose
<code class="code">next</code> field points to the next object in the chain:
<code class="code">header.next.buffer</code> points to the next buffer (which could be
a killed buffer), and <code class="code">header.next.vector</code> points to the next
vector in a free list.  If a vector is small (smaller than or equal to
<code class="code">VBLOCK_BYTES_MAX</code> bytes, see <samp class="file">alloc.c</samp>), then
<code class="code">header.next.nbytes</code> contains the vector size in bytes.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-garbage-collection"></a>
<p>It is quite common to use some storage for a while, then release it
by (for example) killing a buffer or deleting the last pointer to an
object.  Emacs provides a <em class="dfn">garbage collector</em> to reclaim this
abandoned storage.  The garbage collector operates by finding and
marking all Lisp objects that are still accessible to Lisp programs.
To begin with, it assumes all the symbols, their values and associated
function definitions, and any data presently on the stack, are
accessible.  Any objects that can be reached indirectly through other
accessible objects are also accessible.
</p>
<p>When marking is finished, all objects still unmarked are garbage.  No
matter what the Lisp program or the user does, it is impossible to refer
to them, since there is no longer a way to reach them.  Their space
might as well be reused, since no one will miss them.  The second
(&ldquo;sweep&rdquo;) phase of the garbage collector arranges to reuse them.
</p>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-free-list"></a>
<p>The sweep phase puts unused cons cells onto a <em class="dfn">free list</em>
for future allocation; likewise for symbols and markers.  It compacts
the accessible strings so they occupy fewer 8k blocks; then it frees the
other 8k blocks.  Unreachable vectors from vector blocks are coalesced
to create largest possible free areas; if a free area spans a complete
4k block, that block is freed.  Otherwise, the free area is recorded
in a free list array, where each entry corresponds to a free list
of areas of the same size.  Large vectors, buffers, and other large
objects are allocated and freed individually.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-CL-note_002d_002d_002dallocate-more-storage"></a>
<blockquote class="quotation">
<p><b class="b">Common Lisp note:</b> Unlike other Lisps, GNU Emacs Lisp does not
call the garbage collector when the free list is empty.  Instead, it
simply requests the operating system to allocate more storage, and
processing continues until <code class="code">gc-cons-threshold</code> bytes have been
used.
</p>
<p>This means that you can make sure that the garbage collector will not
run during a certain portion of a Lisp program by calling the garbage
collector explicitly just before it (provided that portion of the
program does not use so much space as to force a second garbage
collection).

<dd><p>This command runs a garbage collection, and returns information on

spontaneously if you use more than <code class="code">gc-cons-threshold</code> bytes of

<dd><p>The value of this variable is the number of bytes of storage that must
be allocated for Lisp objects after one garbage collection in order to
trigger another garbage collection.  A cons cell counts as eight bytes,
a string as one byte per character plus a few bytes of overhead, and so
on; space allocated to the contents of buffers does not count.  Note
that the subsequent garbage collection does not happen immediately when
the threshold is exhausted, but only the next time the Lisp evaluator is
called.
</p>
<p>The initial threshold value is 800,000.  If you specify a larger
value, garbage collection will happen less often.  This reduces the
amount of time spent garbage collecting, but increases total memory use.
You may want to do this when running a program that creates lots of
Lisp data.
</p>
<p>You can make collections more frequent by specifying a smaller value,
down to 10,000.  A value less than 10,000 will remain in effect only
until the subsequent garbage collection, at which time
<code class="code">garbage-collect</code> will set the threshold back to 10,000.

<dd><p>The value of this variable specifies the amount of consing before a
garbage collection occurs, as a fraction of the current heap size.
This criterion and <code class="code">gc-cons-threshold</code> apply in parallel, and
garbage collection occurs only when both criteria are satisfied.
</p>
<p>As the heap size increases, the time to perform a garbage collection
increases.  Thus, it can be desirable to do them less frequently in
proportion.

<p>The value returned by <code class="code">garbage-collect</code> describes the amount of
memory used by Lisp data, broken down by data type.  By contrast, the
