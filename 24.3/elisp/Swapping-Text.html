<p>Specialized modes sometimes need to let the user access from the
same buffer several vastly different types of text.  For example, you
may need to display a summary of the buffer text, in addition to
letting the user access the text itself.
</p>
<p>This could be implemented with multiple buffers (kept in sync when
the user edits the text), or with narrowing (see <a class="pxref" href="Narrowing.html">Narrowing</a>).  But
these alternatives might sometimes become tedious or prohibitively
expensive, especially if each type of text requires expensive
buffer-global operations in order to provide correct display and
editing commands.
</p>
<p>Emacs provides another facility for such modes: you can quickly swap
buffer text between two buffers with <code class="code">buffer-swap-text</code>.  This
function is very fast because it doesn&rsquo;t move any text, it only
changes the internal data structures of the buffer object to point to
a different chunk of text.  Using it, you can pretend that a group of
two or more buffers are actually a single virtual buffer that holds
the contents of all the individual buffers together.
</p>
<dl class="first-deffn first-defun-alias-first-deffn">
<dt class="deffn defun-alias-deffn" id="index-buffer_002dswap_002dtext"><span class="category-def">Function: </span><span><strong class="def-name">buffer-swap-text</strong> <var class="def-var-arguments">buffer</var><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-buffer_002dswap_002dtext"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>This function swaps the text of the current buffer and that of its
argument <var class="var">buffer</var>.  It signals an error if one of the two buffers
is an indirect buffer (see <a class="pxref" href="Indirect-Buffers.html">Indirect Buffers</a>) or is a base buffer
of an indirect buffer.
</p>
<p>All the buffer properties that are related to the buffer text are
swapped as well: the positions of point and mark, all the markers, the
overlays, the text properties, the undo list, the value of the
<code class="code">enable-multibyte-characters</code> flag (see <a class="pxref" href="Text-Representations.html">enable-multibyte-characters</a>), etc.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>If you use <code class="code">buffer-swap-text</code> on a file-visiting buffer, you
should set up a hook to save the buffer&rsquo;s original text rather than
what it was swapped with.  <code class="code">write-region-annotate-functions</code>
works for this purpose.  You should probably set
<code class="code">buffer-saved-size</code> to &minus;2 in the buffer, so that changes
in the text it is swapped with will not interfere with auto-saving.
