<p>A Lisp program consists of a set of <em class="dfn">expressions</em>, or
<em class="dfn">forms</em> (see <a class="pxref" href="Forms.html">Kinds of Forms</a>).  We control the order of execution of
these forms by enclosing them in <em class="dfn">control structures</em>.  Control
structures are special forms which control when, whether, or how many
times to execute the forms they contain.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-textual-order"></a>
<p>The simplest order of execution is sequential execution: first form
<var class="var">a</var>, then form <var class="var">b</var>, and so on.  This is what happens when you
write several forms in succession in the body of a function, or at top
level in a file of Lisp code&mdash;the forms are executed in the order
written.  We call this <em class="dfn">textual order</em>.  For example, if a function
body consists of two forms <var class="var">a</var> and <var class="var">b</var>, evaluation of the
function evaluates first <var class="var">a</var> and then <var class="var">b</var>.  The result of
evaluating <var class="var">b</var> becomes the value of the function.
</p>
<p>Explicit control structures make possible an order of execution other
than sequential.
</p>
<p>Emacs Lisp provides several kinds of control structure, including
other varieties of sequencing, conditionals, iteration, and (controlled)
jumps&mdash;all discussed below.  The built-in control structures are
special forms since their subforms are not necessarily evaluated or not
evaluated sequentially.  You can use macros to define your own control
structure constructs (see <a class="pxref" href="Macros.html">Macros</a>).
