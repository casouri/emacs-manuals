<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package_002dinstall"></a>
<p>Packages are most conveniently installed using the package menu
(see <a class="pxref" href="Package-Menu.html">The Package Menu Buffer</a>), but you can also use the command <kbd class="kbd">M-x
package-install</kbd>.  This prompts for the name of a package with the
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">available</samp>&rsquo; status, then downloads and installs it.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package-requirements"></a>
<p>A package may <em class="dfn">require</em> certain other packages to be installed,
because it relies on functionality provided by them.  When Emacs
installs such a package, it also automatically downloads and installs
any required package that is not already installed.  (If a required
package is somehow unavailable, Emacs signals an error and stops
installation.)  A package&rsquo;s requirements list is shown in its help
buffer.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package_002darchives"></a>
<p>By default, packages are downloaded from a single package archive
maintained by the Emacs developers.  This is controlled by the
variable <code class="code">package-archives</code>, whose value is a list of package
archives known to Emacs.  Each list element must have the form
<code class="code">(<var class="var">id</var> . <var class="var">location</var>)</code>, where <var class="var">id</var> is the name of a
package archive and <var class="var">location</var> is the <abbr class="acronym">HTTP</abbr> address or
directory name of the package archive.  You can alter this list if you
wish to use third party package archives&mdash;but do so at your own risk,
and use only third parties that you think you can trust!
</p>
<p>Once a package is downloaded and installed, it is <em class="dfn">loaded</em> into
the current Emacs session.  Loading a package is not quite the same as
loading a Lisp library (see <a class="pxref" href="Lisp-Libraries.html">Libraries of Lisp Code for Emacs</a>); its effect varies
from package to package.  Most packages just make some new commands
available, while others have more wide-ranging effects on the Emacs
session.  For such information, consult the package&rsquo;s help buffer.
</p>
<p>By default, Emacs also automatically loads all installed packages in
subsequent Emacs sessions.  This happens at startup, after processing
the init file (see <a class="pxref" href="Init-File.html">The Emacs Initialization File</a>).  As an exception, Emacs does not
load packages at startup if invoked with the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-q</samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">--no-init-file</samp>&rsquo; options (see <a class="pxref" href="Initial-Options.html">Initial Options</a>).
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package_002denable_002dat_002dstartup"></a>
<p>To disable automatic package loading, change the variable
<code class="code">package-enable-at-startup</code> to <code class="code">nil</code>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package_002dinitialize"></a>
<p>The reason automatic package loading occurs after loading the init
file is that user options only receive their customized values after
loading the init file, including user options which affect the
packaging system.  In some circumstances, you may want to load
packages explicitly in your init file (usually because some other code
in your init file depends on a package).  In that case, your init file
should call the function <code class="code">package-initialize</code>.  It is up to you
to ensure that relevant user options, such as <code class="code">package-load-list</code>
(see below), are set up prior to the <code class="code">package-initialize</code> call.
You should also set <code class="code">package-enable-at-startup</code> to <code class="code">nil</code>, to
avoid loading the packages again after processing the init file.
Alternatively, you may choose to completely inhibit package loading at
startup, and invoke the command <kbd class="kbd">M-x package-initialize</kbd> to load
your packages manually.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package_002dload_002dlist"></a>
<p>For finer control over package loading, you can use the variable
<code class="code">package-load-list</code>.  Its value should be a list.  A list element
of the form <code class="code">(<var class="var">name</var> <var class="var">version</var>)</code> tells Emacs to load
version <var class="var">version</var> of the package named <var class="var">name</var>.  Here,
<var class="var">version</var> should be a version string (corresponding to a specific
version of the package), or <code class="code">t</code> (which means to load any
installed version), or <code class="code">nil</code> (which means no version; this
&ldquo;disables&rdquo; the package, preventing it from being loaded).  A list
element can also be the symbol <code class="code">all</code>, which means to load the
latest installed version of any package not named by the other list
elements.  The default value is just <code class="code">'(all)</code>.
</p>
<p>For example, if you set <code class="code">package-load-list</code> to <code class="code">'((muse
&quot;3.20&quot;) all)</code>, then Emacs only loads version 3.20 of the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">muse</samp>&rsquo;
package, plus any installed version of packages other than
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">muse</samp>&rsquo;.  Any other version of &lsquo;<samp class="samp">muse</samp>&rsquo; that happens to be
installed will be ignored.  The &lsquo;<samp class="samp">muse</samp>&rsquo; package will be listed in
the package menu with the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">held</samp>&rsquo; status.
