<span id="Other-Search_002dand_002dLoop-Commands"></span><h3 class="section">15.11 Other Search-and-Loop Commands</h3>

<p>Here are some other commands that find matches for a regular
expression.  They all ignore case in matching, if the pattern contains
no upper-case letters and <code>case-fold-search</code> is non-<code>nil</code>.
Aside from <code>occur</code> and its variants, all operate on the text from
point to the end of the buffer, or on the region if it is active.

<dl compact="compact">
<dt><kbd>M-x multi-isearch-buffers</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Prompt for one or more buffer names, ending with <tt class="key">RET</tt>; then,
begin a multi-buffer incremental search in those buffers.  (If the
search fails in one buffer, the next <kbd>C-s</kbd> tries searching the
next specified buffer, and so forth.)  With a prefix argument, prompt
for a regexp and begin a multi-buffer incremental search in buffers
matching that regexp.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>M-x multi-isearch-buffers-regexp</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>This command is just like <code>multi-isearch-buffers</code>, except it
performs an incremental regexp search.
</p>
<span id="index-Occur-mode"></span>
<span id="index-mode_002c-Occur"></span>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>M-x occur</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Prompt for a regexp, and display a list showing each line in the
buffer that contains a match for it.  To limit the search to part of
the buffer, narrow to that part (see <a href="Narrowing.html">Narrowing</a>).  A numeric
argument <var>n</var> specifies that <var>n</var> lines of context are to be
displayed before and after each matching line.
</p>
<span id="index-RET-_0028Occur-mode_0029"></span>
<span id="index-o-_0028Occur-mode_0029"></span>
<span id="index-C_002do-_0028Occur-mode_0029"></span>
<p>In the <samp>*Occur*</samp> buffer, you can click on each entry, or move
point there and type <tt class="key">RET</tt>, to visit the corresponding position in
the buffer that was searched.  <kbd>o</kbd> and <kbd>C-o</kbd> display the match
in another window; <kbd>C-o</kbd> does not select it.  Alternatively, you
can use the <kbd>C-x `</kbd> (<code>next-error</code>) command to visit the
occurrences one by one (see <a href="Compilation-Mode.html">Compilation Mode</a>).
</p>
<span id="index-Occur-Edit-mode"></span>
<span id="index-mode_002c-Occur-Edit"></span>
<p>Typing <kbd>e</kbd> in the <samp>*Occur*</samp> buffer switches to Occur Edit
mode, in which edits made to the entries are also applied to the text
in the originating buffer.  Type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> to return to Occur
mode.
</p>
<p>The command <kbd>M-x list-matching-lines</kbd> is a synonym for <kbd>M-x
occur</kbd>.
</p>
<span id="index-M_002ds-o"></span>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>M-s o</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Run <code>occur</code> using the search string of the last incremental
string search.  You can also run <kbd>M-s o</kbd> when an incremental
search is active; this uses the current search string.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>M-x multi-occur</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>This command is just like <code>occur</code>, except it is able to search
through multiple buffers.  It asks you to specify the buffer names one
by one.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>M-x multi-occur-in-matching-buffers</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>This command is similar to <code>multi-occur</code>, except the buffers to
search are specified by a regular expression that matches visited file
names.  With a prefix argument, it uses the regular expression to
match buffer names instead.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>M-x how-many</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Prompt for a regexp, and print the number of matches for it in the
buffer after point.  If the region is active, this operates on the
region instead.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>M-x flush-lines</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Prompt for a regexp, and delete each line that contains a match for
it, operating on the text after point.  This command deletes the
current line if it contains a match starting after point.  If the
region is active, it operates on the region instead; if a line
partially contained in the region contains a match entirely contained
in the region, it is deleted.
</p>
<p>If a match is split across lines, <code>flush-lines</code> deletes all those
lines.  It deletes the lines before starting to look for the next
match; hence, it ignores a match starting on the same line at which
another match ended.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>M-x keep-lines</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Prompt for a regexp, and delete each line that <em>does not</em> contain
a match for it, operating on the text after point.  If point is not at
the beginning of a line, this command always keeps the current line.
If the region is active, the command operates on the region instead;
it never deletes lines that are only partially contained in the region
(a newline that ends a line counts as part of that line).
</p>
<p>If a match is split across lines, this command keeps all those lines.
</p></dd>
