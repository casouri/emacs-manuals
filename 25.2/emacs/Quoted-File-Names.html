<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-quoting-file-names"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-file-names_002c-quote-special-characters"></a>
<p>You can <em class="dfn">quote</em> an absolute file name to prevent special
characters and syntax in it from having their special effects.
The way to do this is to add &lsquo;<samp class="samp">/:</samp>&rsquo; at the beginning.
</p>
<p>For example, you can quote a local file name which appears remote, to
prevent it from being treated as a remote file name.  Thus, if you have
a directory named <samp class="file">/foo:</samp> and a file named <samp class="file">bar</samp> in it, you
can refer to that file in Emacs as &lsquo;<samp class="samp">/:/foo:/bar</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">/:</samp>&rsquo; can also prevent &lsquo;<samp class="samp">~</samp>&rsquo; from being treated as a special
character for a user&rsquo;s home directory.  For example, <samp class="file">/:/tmp/~hack</samp>
refers to a file whose name is <samp class="file">~hack</samp> in directory <samp class="file">/tmp</samp>.
</p>
<p>Quoting with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">/:</samp>&rsquo; is also a way to enter in the minibuffer a
file name that contains &lsquo;<samp class="samp">$</samp>&rsquo;.  In order for this to work, the
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">/:</samp>&rsquo; must be at the beginning of the minibuffer contents.  (You
can also double each &lsquo;<samp class="samp">$</samp>&rsquo;; see <a class="ref" href="File-Names.html#File-Names-with-_0024">File Names with $</a>.)
</p>
<p>You can also quote wildcard characters with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">/:</samp>&rsquo;, for visiting.
For example, <samp class="file">/:/tmp/foo*bar</samp> visits the file
<samp class="file">/tmp/foo*bar</samp>.
</p>
<p>Another method of getting the same result is to enter
<samp class="file">/tmp/foo[*]bar</samp>, which is a wildcard specification that matches
only <samp class="file">/tmp/foo*bar</samp>.  However, in many cases there is no need to
quote the wildcard characters because even unquoted they give the
right result.  For example, if the only file name in <samp class="file">/tmp</samp> that
starts with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">foo</samp>&rsquo; and ends with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">bar</samp>&rsquo; is <samp class="file">foo*bar</samp>,
then specifying <samp class="file">/tmp/foo*bar</samp> will visit only
<samp class="file">/tmp/foo*bar</samp>.
