<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hooks"></a>

<p>A <em class="dfn">hook</em> is a variable where you can store a function or functions
to be called on a particular occasion by an existing program.  Emacs
provides hooks for the sake of customization.  Most often, hooks are set
up in the init file (see <a class="pxref" href="Init-File.html">The Init File</a>), but Lisp programs can set them also.
See <a class="xref" href="Standard-Hooks.html">Standard Hooks</a>, for a list of some standard hook variables.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-normal-hook"></a>
<p>Most of the hooks in Emacs are <em class="dfn">normal hooks</em>.  These variables
contain lists of functions to be called with no arguments.  By
convention, whenever the hook name ends in &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-hook</samp>&rsquo;, that tells
you it is normal.  We try to make all hooks normal, as much as
possible, so that you can use them in a uniform way.
</p>
<p>Every major mode command is supposed to run a normal hook called the
<em class="dfn">mode hook</em> as one of the last steps of initialization.  This makes
it easy for a user to customize the behavior of the mode, by overriding
the buffer-local variable assignments already made by the mode.  Most
minor mode functions also run a mode hook at the end.  But hooks are
used in other contexts too.  For example, the hook <code class="code">suspend-hook</code>
runs just before Emacs suspends itself (see <a class="pxref" href="Suspending-Emacs.html">Suspending Emacs</a>).
</p>
<p>The recommended way to add a hook function to a hook is by calling
<code class="code">add-hook</code> (see <a class="pxref" href="Setting-Hooks.html">Setting Hooks</a>).  The hook functions may be any
of the valid kinds of functions that <code class="code">funcall</code> accepts (see <a class="pxref" href="What-Is-a-Function.html">What Is a Function?</a>).  Most normal hook variables are initially void;
<code class="code">add-hook</code> knows how to deal with this.  You can add hooks either
globally or buffer-locally with <code class="code">add-hook</code>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-abnormal-hook"></a>
<p>If the hook variable&rsquo;s name does not end with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-hook</samp>&rsquo;, that
indicates it is probably an <em class="dfn">abnormal hook</em>.  That means the hook
functions are called with arguments, or their return values are used
in some way.  The hook&rsquo;s documentation says how the functions are
called.  You can use <code class="code">add-hook</code> to add a function to an abnormal
hook, but you must write the function to follow the hook&rsquo;s calling
convention.  By convention, abnormal hook names end in &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-functions</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-single_002dfunction-hook"></a>
<p>If the variable&rsquo;s name ends in &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-function</samp>&rsquo;, then its value is
just a single function, not a list of functions.  <code class="code">add-hook</code> cannot be
used to modify such a <em class="emph">single function hook</em>, and you have to use
<code class="code">add-function</code> instead (see <a class="pxref" href="Advising-Functions.html">Advising Emacs Lisp Functions</a>).
