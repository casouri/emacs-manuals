<h3 class="section">22.19 Bidirectional Editing</h3>
<a name="index-bidirectional-editing"></a>
<a name="index-right_002dto_002dleft-text"></a>

<p>Emacs supports editing text written in scripts, such as Arabic,
Farsi, and Hebrew, whose natural ordering of horizontal text for
display is from right to left.  However, digits and Latin text
embedded in these scripts are still displayed left to right.  It is
also not uncommon to have small portions of text in Arabic or Hebrew
embedded in an otherwise Latin document; e.g., as comments and strings
in a program source file.  For these reasons, text that uses these
scripts is actually <em>bidirectional</em>: a mixture of runs of
left-to-right and right-to-left characters.
</p>
<p>This section describes the facilities and options provided by Emacs
for editing bidirectional text.
</p>
<a name="index-logical-order"></a>
<a name="index-visual-order"></a>
<p>Emacs stores right-to-left and bidirectional text in the so-called
<em>logical</em> (or <em>reading</em>) order: the buffer or string position
of the first character you read precedes that of the next character.
Reordering of bidirectional text into the <em>visual</em> order happens
at display time.  As a result, character positions no longer increase
monotonically with their positions on display.  Emacs implements the
Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (UBA) described in the
<a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr9/">Unicode Standard Annex #9</a>, for
reordering of bidirectional text for display.
It deviates from the UBA only in how continuation lines are displayed
when text direction is opposite to the base paragraph direction,
e.g., when a long line of English text appears in a right-to-left
paragraph.
</p>
<a name="index-bidi_002ddisplay_002dreordering"></a>
<p>The buffer-local variable <code>bidi-display-reordering</code> controls
whether text in the buffer is reordered for display.  If its value is
non-<code>nil</code>, Emacs reorders characters that have right-to-left
directionality when they are displayed.  The default value is
<code>t</code>.
</p>
<a name="index-base-direction-of-paragraphs"></a>
<a name="index-paragraph_002c-base-direction"></a>
<a name="index-bidi_002dparagraph_002dstart_002dre"></a>
<a name="index-bidi_002dparagraph_002dseparate_002dre"></a>
<p>Each paragraph of bidirectional text can have its own <em>base
direction</em>, either right-to-left or left-to-right.  Text in
left-to-right paragraphs begins on the screen at the left margin of
the window and is truncated or continued when it reaches the right
margin.  By contrast, text in right-to-left paragraphs is displayed
starting at the right margin and is continued or truncated at the left
margin.  By default, paragraph boundaries are empty lines, i.e., lines
consisting entirely of whitespace characters.  To change that, you can
customize the two variables <code>bidi-paragraph-start-re</code> and
<code>bidi-paragraph-separate-re</code>, whose values should be regular
expressions (strings); e.g., to have a single newline start a new
paragraph, set both of these variables to <code>&quot;^&quot;</code>.  These two
variables are buffer-local (see <a href="Locals.html#Locals">Locals</a>).
</p>
<a name="index-bidi_002dparagraph_002ddirection"></a>
<p>Emacs determines the base direction of each paragraph dynamically,
based on the text at the beginning of the paragraph.  However,
sometimes a buffer may need to force a certain base direction for its
paragraphs.  The variable <code>bidi-paragraph-direction</code>, if
non-<code>nil</code>, disables the dynamic determination of the base
direction, and instead forces all paragraphs in the buffer to have the
direction specified by its buffer-local value.  The value can be either
<code>right-to-left</code> or <code>left-to-right</code>.  Any other value is
interpreted as <code>nil</code>.
</p>
<a name="index-LRM"></a>
<a name="index-RLM"></a>
<p>Alternatively, you can control the base direction of a paragraph by
inserting special formatting characters in front of the paragraph.
The special character <code>RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK</code>, or <small>RLM</small>, forces
the right-to-left direction on the following paragraph, while
<code>LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK</code>, or <small>LRM</small> forces the left-to-right
direction.  (You can use <kbd>C-x 8 <span class="key">RET</span></kbd> to insert these characters.)
In a GUI session, the <small>LRM</small> and <small>RLM</small> characters display as very
thin blank characters; on text terminals they display as blanks.
</p>
<p>Because characters are reordered for display, Emacs commands that
operate in the logical order or on stretches of buffer positions may
produce unusual effects.  For example, the commands <kbd>C-f</kbd> and
<kbd>C-b</kbd> move point in the logical order, so the cursor will
sometimes jump when point traverses reordered bidirectional text.
Similarly, a highlighted region covering a contiguous range of
character positions may look discontinuous if the region spans
reordered text.  This is normal and similar to the behavior of other
programs that support bidirectional text.
</p>
<a name="index-RIGHT_002c-and-bidirectional-text"></a>
<a name="index-LEFT_002c-and-bidirectional-text"></a>
<a name="index-right_002dchar_002c-and-bidirectional-text"></a>
<a name="index-left_002dchar_002c-and-bidirectional-text"></a>
<p>Cursor motion commands bound to arrow keys, such as <tt class="key">LEFT</tt> and
<kbd>C-<span class="key">RIGHT</span></kbd>, are sensitive to the base direction of the
current paragraph.  In a left-to-right paragraph, commands bound to
<tt class="key">RIGHT</tt> with or without modifiers move <em>forward</em> through
buffer text, but in a right-to-left paragraph they move
<em>backward</em> instead.  This reflects the fact that in a
right-to-left paragraph buffer positions predominantly increase when
moving to the left on display.
</p>
<p>When you move out of a paragraph, the meaning of the arrow keys
might change if the base direction of the preceding or the following
paragraph is different from the paragraph out of which you moved.
When that happens, you need to adjust the arrow key you press to the
new base direction.
</p>
<a name="index-visual_002dorder_002dcursor_002dmovement"></a>
<a name="index-cursor_002c-visual_002dorder-motion"></a>
<p>By default, <tt class="key">LEFT</tt> and <tt class="key">RIGHT</tt> move in the logical order,
but if <code>visual-order-cursor-movement</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, these
commands move to the character that is, correspondingly, to the left
or right of the current screen position, moving to the next or
previous screen line as appropriate.  Note that this might potentially
move point many buffer positions away, depending on the surrounding
bidirectional context.
