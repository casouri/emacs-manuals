<h3 class="section" id="Reverting-a-Buffer"><span>18.4 Reverting a Buffer<a class="copiable-link" href="#Reverting-a-Buffer"> &para;</a></span></h3>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-revert_002dbuffer"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-drastic-changes"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-reread-a-file"></a>

<p>If you have made extensive changes to a file-visiting buffer and
then change your mind, you can <em class="dfn">revert</em> the changes and go back to
the saved version of the file.  To do this, type <kbd class="kbd">M-x
revert-buffer</kbd>.  Since reverting unintentionally could lose a lot of
work, Emacs asks for confirmation first.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">revert-buffer</code> command tries to position point in such a
way that, if the file was edited only slightly, you will be at
approximately the same part of the text as before.  But if you have
made major changes, point may end up in a totally different location.
</p>
<p>Reverting marks the buffer as not modified.  It also clears the
buffer&rsquo;s undo history (see <a class="pxref" href="Undo.html">Undo</a>).  Thus, the reversion cannot be
undone&mdash;if you change your mind yet again, you can&rsquo;t use the undo
commands to bring the reverted changes back.
</p>
<p>Some kinds of buffers that are not associated with files, such as
Dired buffers, can also be reverted.  For them, reverting means
recalculating their contents.  Buffers created explicitly with
<kbd class="kbd">C-x b</kbd> cannot be reverted; <code class="code">revert-buffer</code> reports an error
if you try.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-revert_002dwithout_002dquery"></a>
<p>When you edit a file that changes automatically and frequently&mdash;for
example, a log of output from a process that continues to run&mdash;it may
be useful for Emacs to revert the file without querying you.  To
request this behavior, set the variable <code class="code">revert-without-query</code> to
a list of regular expressions.  When a file name matches one of these
regular expressions, <code class="code">find-file</code> and <code class="code">revert-buffer</code> will
revert it automatically if it has changed&mdash;provided the buffer itself
is not modified.  (If you have edited the text, it would be wrong to
discard your changes.)
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Global-Auto-Revert-mode"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-mode_002c-Global-Auto-Revert"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Auto-Revert-mode"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-mode_002c-Auto-Revert"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-global_002dauto_002drevert_002dmode"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-auto_002drevert_002dmode"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-auto_002drevert_002dtail_002dmode"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-auto_002drevert_002dinterval"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-auto_002drevert_002dremote_002dfiles"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-auto_002drevert_002dverbose"></a>
<p>You can also tell Emacs to revert buffers periodically.  To do this
for a specific buffer, enable the minor mode Auto-Revert mode by
typing <kbd class="kbd">M-x auto-revert-mode</kbd>.  This automatically reverts the
current buffer when its visited file changes on disk.  To do the same
for all file buffers, type <kbd class="kbd">M-x global-auto-revert-mode</kbd> to enable
Global Auto-Revert mode.  These minor modes do not check or revert
remote files, because that is usually too slow.  This behavior can be
changed by setting the variable <code class="code">auto-revert-remote-files</code> to
non-<code class="code">nil</code>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-file-notifications"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-auto_002drevert_002duse_002dnotify"></a>
<p>By default, Auto-Revert mode works using <em class="dfn">file notifications</em>,
whereby changes in the filesystem are reported to Emacs by the OS.
You can disable use of file notifications by customizing the variable
<code class="code">auto-revert-use-notify</code> to a <code class="code">nil</code> value, then Emacs will
check for file changes by polling every five seconds.  You can change
the polling interval through the variable <code class="code">auto-revert-interval</code>.
</p>
<p>Not all systems support file notifications; where they are not
supported, <code class="code">auto-revert-use-notify</code> will be <code class="code">nil</code> by
default.
</p>
<p>One use of Auto-Revert mode is to &ldquo;tail&rdquo; a file such as a system
log, so that changes made to that file by other programs are
continuously displayed.  To do this, just move the point to the end of
the buffer, and it will stay there as the file contents change.
However, if you are sure that the file will only change by growing at
the end, use Auto-Revert Tail mode instead
(<code class="code">auto-revert-tail-mode</code>).  It is more efficient for this.
Auto-Revert Tail mode works also for remote files.
</p>
<p>When a buffer is auto-reverted, a message is generated.  This can be
suppressed by setting <code class="code">auto-revert-verbose</code> to <code class="code">nil</code>.
</p>
<p>In Dired buffers (see <a class="pxref" href="Dired.html">Dired, the Directory Editor</a>), Auto-Revert mode refreshes the
buffer when a file is created or deleted in the buffer&rsquo;s directory.
</p>
<p>See <a class="xref" href="VC-Undo.html">Undoing Version Control Actions</a>, for commands to revert to earlier versions of files
under version control.  See <a class="xref" href="VC-Mode-Line.html">Version Control and the Mode Line</a>, for Auto Revert
peculiarities when visiting files under version control.
