<p>So far, we have explained the ins and outs of the global map.  Major
modes customize Emacs by providing their own key bindings in
<em class="dfn">local keymaps</em>.  For example, C mode overrides <kbd class="key">TAB</kbd> to make
it indent the current line for C code.  Minor modes can also have
local keymaps; whenever a minor mode is in effect, the definitions in
its keymap override both the major mode&rsquo;s local keymap and the global
keymap.  In addition, portions of text in the buffer can specify their
own keymaps, which override all other keymaps.
</p>
<p>A local keymap can redefine a key as a prefix key by defining it as
a prefix keymap.  If the key is also defined globally as a prefix, its
local and global definitions (both keymaps) effectively combine: both
definitions are used to look up the event that follows the prefix key.
For example, if a local keymap defines <kbd class="kbd">C-c</kbd> as a prefix keymap,
and that keymap defines <kbd class="kbd">C-z</kbd> as a command, this provides a local
meaning for <kbd class="kbd">C-c C-z</kbd>.  This does not affect other sequences that
start with <kbd class="kbd">C-c</kbd>; if those sequences don&rsquo;t have their own local
bindings, their global bindings remain in effect.
</p>
<p>Another way to think of this is that Emacs handles a multi-event key
sequence by looking in several keymaps, one by one, for a binding of the
whole key sequence.  First it checks the minor mode keymaps for minor
modes that are enabled, then it checks the major mode&rsquo;s keymap, and then
it checks the global keymap.  This is not precisely how key lookup
works, but it&rsquo;s good enough for understanding the results in ordinary
circumstances.
