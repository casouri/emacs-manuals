<p>A <em class="dfn">cons cell</em> is an object that consists of two slots, called
the <small class="sc">CAR</small> slot and the <small class="sc">CDR</small> slot.  Each slot can <em class="dfn">hold</em> any
Lisp object.  We also say that the <small class="sc">CAR</small> of this cons cell is
whatever object its <small class="sc">CAR</small> slot currently holds, and likewise for
the <small class="sc">CDR</small>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-list-structure"></a>
<p>A <em class="dfn">list</em> is a series of cons cells, linked together so that the
<small class="sc">CDR</small> slot of each cons cell holds either the next cons cell or the
empty list.  The empty list is actually the symbol <code class="code">nil</code>.
See <a class="xref" href="Lists.html">Lists</a>, for details.  Because most cons cells are used as part
of lists, we refer to any structure made out of cons cells as a
<em class="dfn">list structure</em>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-linked-list"></a>
<blockquote class="quotation">
<p>A note to C programmers: a Lisp list thus works as a <em class="dfn">linked list</em>
built up of cons cells.  Because pointers in Lisp are implicit, we do
not distinguish between a cons cell slot holding a value versus
pointing to the value.
</p></blockquote>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-atoms"></a>
<p>Because cons cells are so central to Lisp, we also have a word for
an object which is not a cons cell.  These objects are called
<em class="dfn">atoms</em>.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-_0028_2026_0029-in-lists"></a>
<p>The read syntax and printed representation for lists are identical, and
consist of a left parenthesis, an arbitrary number of elements, and a
right parenthesis.  Here are examples of lists:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(A 2 &quot;A&quot;)            ; <span class="r">A list of three elements.</span>
()                   ; <span class="r">A list of no elements (the empty list).</span>
nil                  ; <span class="r">A list of no elements (the empty list).</span>
(&quot;A ()&quot;)             ; <span class="r">A list of one element: the string <code class="code">&quot;A ()&quot;</code>.</span>
(A ())               ; <span class="r">A list of two elements: <code class="code">A</code> and the empty list.</span>
(A nil)              ; <span class="r">Equivalent to the previous.</span>
((A B C))            ; <span class="r">A list of one element</span>
                     ;   <span class="r">(which is a list of three elements).</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Upon reading, each object inside the parentheses becomes an element
of the list.  That is, a cons cell is made for each element.  The
<small class="sc">CAR</small> slot of the cons cell holds the element, and its <small class="sc">CDR</small>
slot refers to the next cons cell of the list, which holds the next
element in the list.  The <small class="sc">CDR</small> slot of the last cons cell is set to
hold <code class="code">nil</code>.
</p>
<p>The names <small class="sc">CAR</small> and <small class="sc">CDR</small> derive from the history of Lisp.  The
original Lisp implementation ran on an IBM&nbsp;704<!-- /@w --> computer which
divided words into two parts, the address and the
decrement; <small class="sc">CAR</small> was an instruction to extract the contents of
the address part of a register, and <small class="sc">CDR</small> an instruction to extract
the contents of the decrement.  By contrast, cons cells are named
for the function <code class="code">cons</code> that creates them, which in turn was named
for its purpose, the construction of cells.
