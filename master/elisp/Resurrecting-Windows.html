<p>After a window has been deleted (see <a class="pxref" href="Deleting-Windows.html">Deleting Windows</a>) it cannot be
used any more by functions that require a valid window as their argument
even if some Lisp variable still references that window.  When the last
reference to a window has ceased to exist, the window&rsquo;s Lisp object will
be eventually recycled by the garbage collector (see <a class="pxref" href="Garbage-Collection.html">Garbage Collection</a>).
</p>
<p>There are two ways to resurrect a deleted window whose object has not
been yet recycled by the collector: The first is to keep a reference to
that window in a saved window configuration (see <a class="pxref" href="Window-Configurations.html">Window Configurations</a>) and then call <code class="code">set-window-configuration</code> with that
configuration as argument.  The second one is to keep a reference to
that window in a variable or let-bind it and then use that reference as
<var class="var">refer</var> argument in <code class="code">split-window</code> (see <a class="pxref" href="Splitting-Windows.html">Splitting Windows</a>).
</p>
<p>The major difference between these two is that
<code class="code">set-window-configuration</code> restores the frame layout as it existed
before deleting the window.  The <code class="code">split-window</code> approach, on the
other hand, allows for arbitrary variations of the layout.
</p>
<p>Consider the following example starting with a frame containing a single
window showing the buffer <samp class="file">*scratch*</samp>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">(let* ((old (selected-window))
       (new (split-window old nil 'right))
       overlay)
  (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create &quot;*Messages*&quot;)
    (set-window-buffer new (current-buffer))
    (setq overlay (make-overlay (point-min) (point-max)))
    (overlay-put overlay 'face 'highlight)
    (overlay-put overlay 'window new)
    (message &quot;new %s parent %s&quot; new (window-parent new))
    (sit-for 3))
  (delete-window new)
  (setq new (split-window old nil 'left))
  (set-window-buffer new (get-buffer-create &quot;*Messages*&quot;))
  (format &quot;new %s parent %s&quot; new (window-parent new)))
</pre></div></div>

<p>When you run that code in <samp class="file">*scratch*</samp> it will first split the
window showing <samp class="file">*scratch*</samp> to display <samp class="file">*Messages*</samp> in a new
window on the right.  It also sets up an overlay with a window property
to highlight the text of <samp class="file">*Messages*</samp> in the new window and
displays a message showing the new window and its parent in the window
tree.  It then deletes the new window and resurrects it on the left of
the <samp class="file">*scratch*</samp> window again displaying a message showing the new
window and its parent in the window tree.
</p>
<p>Note that both, new window and its parent have changed after moving the
<samp class="file">*Messages*</samp> window to the left.  Also, the highlighting disappears
because any properties set up for the new window on the right are lost
when the new window is re-created on the left.
</p>
<p>The following code uses the <var class="var">refer</var> argument of <code class="code">split-window</code>
instead.
</p>
<div class="example">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">(let* ((old (selected-window))
       (new (split-window old nil 'right))
       overlay)
  (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create &quot;*Messages*&quot;)
    (set-window-buffer new (current-buffer))
    (setq overlay (make-overlay (point-min) (point-max)))
    (overlay-put overlay 'face 'highlight)
    (overlay-put overlay 'window new)
    (message &quot;new %s parent %s&quot; new (window-parent new))
    (sit-for 3))
  (delete-window new)
  (split-window old nil 'left nil new)
  (format &quot;new %s parent %s&quot; new (window-parent new)))
</pre></div></div>

<p>Note that all properties of the resurrected window like its decorations,
parameters as well as any overlays with a window property are preserved
as if that window had never been deleted.  The only things that changed
are its position in the window tree and consequently the values returned
by <code class="code">window-left-child</code> of its parent window as well as the values
returned by <code class="code">window-prev-sibling</code> and <code class="code">window-next-sibling</code> of
the window and its sibling.
</p>
<p>The following code passes both, the new window on the right and its
parent, via the <var class="var">refer</var> argument to <code class="code">split-window</code> instead.
</p>
<div class="example">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">(let* ((old (selected-window))
       (new (split-window old nil 'right))
       (parent (window-parent new))
       overlay)
  (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create &quot;*Messages*&quot;)
    (set-window-buffer new (current-buffer))
    (setq overlay (make-overlay (point-min) (point-max)))
    (overlay-put overlay 'face 'highlight)
    (overlay-put overlay 'window new)
    (message &quot;new %s parent %s&quot; new (window-parent new))
    (sit-for 3))
  (delete-window new)
  (split-window old nil 'left nil (cons new parent))
  (format &quot;new %s parent %s&quot; new (window-parent new)))
</pre></div></div>

<p>Note that the parent window has been resurrected along with the new
window.
</p>
<p>Resurrecting dead windows is useful to preserve the identity of windows
in actions that are supposed to do that like moving windows around on a
frame or hiding them temporarily.  Any properties of such a window like
its decorations, the buffer it has shown previously, that buffer&rsquo;s start
and point position in the window, the window&rsquo;s dedicated status or its
cursor type are left untouched and there&rsquo;s no need to recreate them from
scratch.  For internal windows, the value of that window&rsquo;s combination
limit is preserved which means that the window can be recombined
(see <a class="pxref" href="Recombining-Windows.html">Recombining Windows</a>) as before.
