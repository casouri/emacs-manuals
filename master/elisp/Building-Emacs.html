<h3 class="section">E.1 Building Emacs</h3>
<a name="index-building-Emacs"></a>
<a name="index-temacs"></a>

<p>This section explains the steps involved in building the Emacs
executable.  You don&rsquo;t have to know this material to build and install
Emacs, since the makefiles do all these things automatically.  This
information is pertinent to Emacs developers.
</p>
<p>Building Emacs requires GNU Make version 3.81 or later.
</p>
<p>Compilation of the C source files in the <samp>src</samp> directory
produces an executable file called <samp>temacs</samp>, also called a
<em>bare impure Emacs</em>.  It contains the Emacs Lisp interpreter and
I/O routines, but not the editing commands.
</p>
<a name="index-loadup_002eel"></a>
<p>The command <code>temacs&nbsp;<span class="nolinebreak">-l</span>&nbsp;loadup</code><!-- /@w --> would run <samp>temacs</samp>
and direct it to load <samp>loadup.el</samp>.  The <code>loadup</code> library
loads additional Lisp libraries, which set up the normal Emacs editing
environment.  After this step, the Emacs executable is no longer
<em>bare</em>.
</p>
<a name="index-dumping-Emacs"></a>
<a name="index-_002d_002dtemacs-option_002c-and-dumping-method"></a>
<p>Because it takes some time to load the standard Lisp files, the
<samp>temacs</samp> executable usually isn&rsquo;t run directly by users.
Instead, one of the last steps of building Emacs runs the command
&lsquo;<samp>temacs&nbsp;<span class="nolinebreak">-batch</span>&nbsp;<span class="nolinebreak">-l</span>&nbsp;loadup&nbsp;<span class="nolinebreak">--temacs=</span><var><span class="nolinebreak">dump-method</span></var></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.  The
special option <samp>--temacs</samp> tells <code>temacs</code> how to record
all the standard preloaded Lisp functions and variables, so that when
you subsequently run Emacs, it will start much faster.  The
<samp>--temacs</samp> option requires an argument <var>dump-method</var>, which
can be one of the following:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>pdump</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><a name="index-dump-file"></a>
<p>Record the preloaded Lisp data in a <em>dump file</em>.  This
method produces an additional data file which Emacs will load at
startup.  The produced dump file is usually called <samp>emacs.pdmp</samp>,
and is installed in the Emacs <code>exec-directory</code> (see <a href="Help-Functions.html#Help-Functions">Help Functions</a>).  This method is the most preferred one, as it does not
require Emacs to employ any special techniques of memory allocation,
which might get in the way of various memory-layout techniques used by
modern systems to enhance security and privacy.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>pbootstrap</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><a name="index-bootstrapping-Emacs"></a>
<p>Like &lsquo;<samp>pdump</samp>&rsquo;, but used while <em>bootstrapping</em> Emacs, when no
previous Emacs binary and no <samp>*.elc</samp> byte-compiled Lisp files are
available.  The produced dump file is usually named
<samp>bootstrap-emacs.pdmp</samp> in this case.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>dump</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><a name="index-unexec"></a>
<p>This method causes <code>temacs</code> to dump out an executable program,
called <samp>emacs</samp>, which has all the standard Lisp files already
preloaded into it.  (The &lsquo;<samp>-batch</samp>&rsquo; argument prevents
<code>temacs</code> from trying to initialize any of its data on the
terminal, so that the tables of terminal information are empty in the
dumped Emacs.)  This method is also known as <em>unexec</em>, because it
produces a program file from a running process, and thus is in some
sense the opposite of executing a program to start a process.
Although this method was the way that Emacs traditionally saved its
state, it is now deprecated.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>bootstrap</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Like &lsquo;<samp>dump</samp>&rsquo;, but used when bootstrapping Emacs with the
<code>unexec</code> method.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="index-preloaded-Lisp-files"></a>
<a name="index-preloaded_002dfile_002dlist"></a>
<p>The dumped <samp>emacs</samp> executable (also called a <em>pure</em> Emacs)
is the one which is installed.  If the portable dumper was used to
build Emacs, the <samp>emacs</samp> executable is actually an exact copy of
<samp>temacs</samp>, and the corresponding <samp>emacs.pdmp</samp> file is
installed as well.  The variable <code>preloaded-file-list</code> stores a
list of the preloaded Lisp files recorded in the dump file or
in the dumped Emacs executable.  If you port Emacs to a new operating
system, and are not able to implement dumping of any kind, then Emacs
must load <samp>loadup.el</samp> each time it starts.
</p>
<a name="index-build-details"></a>
<a name="index-deterministic-build"></a>
<a name="index-_002d_002ddisable_002dbuild_002ddetails-option-to-configure"></a>
<p>By default the dumped <samp>emacs</samp> executable records details such
as the build time and host name.  Use the
<samp>--disable-build-details</samp> option of <code>configure</code> to
suppress these details, so that building and installing Emacs twice
from the same sources is more likely to result in identical copies of
Emacs.
</p>
<a name="index-site_002dload_002eel"></a>
<p>You can specify additional files to preload by writing a library named
<samp>site-load.el</samp> that loads them.  You may need to rebuild Emacs
with an added definition
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">#define SITELOAD_PURESIZE_EXTRA <var>n</var>
</pre></div>

<p>to make <var>n</var> added bytes of pure space to hold the additional files;
see <samp>src/puresize.h</samp>.
(Try adding increments of 20000 until it is big enough.)  However, the
advantage of preloading additional files decreases as machines get
faster.  On modern machines, it is usually not advisable.
</p>
<p>After <samp>loadup.el</samp> reads <samp>site-load.el</samp>, it finds the
documentation strings for primitive and preloaded functions (and
variables) in the file <samp>etc/DOC</samp> where they are stored, by
calling <code>Snarf-documentation</code> (see <a href="Accessing-Documentation.html#Definition-of-Snarf_002ddocumentation">Accessing Documentation</a>).
</p>
<a name="index-site_002dinit_002eel"></a>
<a name="index-preloading-additional-functions-and-variables"></a>
<p>You can specify other Lisp expressions to execute just before dumping
by putting them in a library named <samp>site-init.el</samp>.  This file is
executed after the documentation strings are found.
</p>
<p>If you want to preload function or variable definitions, there are
three ways you can do this and make their documentation strings
accessible when you subsequently run Emacs:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Arrange to scan these files when producing the <samp>etc/DOC</samp> file,
and load them with <samp>site-load.el</samp>.

</li><li> Load the files with <samp>site-init.el</samp>, then copy the files into the
installation directory for Lisp files when you install Emacs.

</li><li> Specify a <code>nil</code> value for <code>byte-compile-dynamic-docstrings</code>
as a local variable in each of these files, and load them with either
<samp>site-load.el</samp> or <samp>site-init.el</samp>.  (This method has the
drawback that the documentation strings take up space in Emacs all the
time.)
</li></ul>

<a name="index-change-load_002dpath-at-configure-time"></a>
<a name="index-_002d_002denable_002dlocallisppath-option-to-configure"></a>
<p>It is not advisable to put anything in <samp>site-load.el</samp> or
<samp>site-init.el</samp> that would alter any of the features that users
expect in an ordinary unmodified Emacs.  If you feel you must override
normal features for your site, do it with <samp>default.el</samp>, so that
users can override your changes if they wish.  See <a href="Startup-Summary.html#Startup-Summary">Startup Summary</a>.
Note that if either <samp>site-load.el</samp> or <samp>site-init.el</samp> changes
<code>load-path</code>, the changes will be lost after dumping.
See <a href="Library-Search.html#Library-Search">Library Search</a>.  To make a permanent change to
<code>load-path</code>, use the <samp>--enable-locallisppath</samp> option
of <code>configure</code>.
</p>
<p>In a package that can be preloaded, it is sometimes necessary (or
useful) to delay certain evaluations until Emacs subsequently starts
up.  The vast majority of such cases relate to the values of
customizable variables.  For example, <code>tutorial-directory</code> is a
variable defined in <samp>startup.el</samp>, which is preloaded.  The default
value is set based on <code>data-directory</code>.  The variable needs to
access the value of <code>data-directory</code> when Emacs starts, not when
it is dumped, because the Emacs executable has probably been installed
in a different location since it was dumped.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-custom_002dinitialize_002ddelay"></a>Function: <strong>custom-initialize-delay</strong> <em>symbol value</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function delays the initialization of <var>symbol</var> to the next
Emacs start.  You normally use this function by specifying it as the
<code>:initialize</code> property of a customizable variable.  (The argument
<var>value</var> is unused, and is provided only for compatibility with the
form Custom expects.)
</p></dd></dl>

<p>In the unlikely event that you need a more general functionality than
<code>custom-initialize-delay</code> provides, you can use
<code>before-init-hook</code> (see <a href="Startup-Summary.html#Startup-Summary">Startup Summary</a>).
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-dump_002demacs_002dportable"></a>Function: <strong>dump-emacs-portable</strong> <em>to-file &amp;optional track-referrers</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function dumps the current state of Emacs into a dump
file <var>to-file</var>, using the <code>pdump</code> method.  Normally, the
dump file is called <samp><var>emacs-name</var>.dmp</samp>, where
<var>emacs-name</var> is the name of the Emacs executable file.  The
optional argument <var>track-referrers</var>, if non-<code>nil</code>, causes the
portable dumper to keep additional information to help track
down the provenance of object types that are not yet supported by the
<code>pdump</code> method.
</p>
<p>Although the portable dumper code can run on many platforms, the dump
files that it produces are not portable&mdash;they can be loaded only by
the Emacs executable that dumped them.
</p>
<p>If you want to use this function in an Emacs that was already dumped,
you must run Emacs with the &lsquo;<samp>-batch</samp>&rsquo; option.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-dump_002demacs"></a>Function: <strong>dump-emacs</strong> <em>to-file from-file</em></dt>
<dd><a name="index-unexec-1"></a>
<p>This function dumps the current state of Emacs into an executable file
<var>to-file</var>, using the <code>unexec</code> method.  It takes symbols from
<var>from-file</var> (this is normally the executable file <samp>temacs</samp>).
</p>
<p>This function cannot be used in an Emacs that was already dumped.
This function is deprecated, and by default Emacs is built without
<code>unexec</code> support so this function is not available.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-pdumper_002dstats"></a>Function: <strong>pdumper-stats</strong></dt>
<dd><p>If the current Emacs session restored its state from a dump
file, this function returns information about the dump file and the
time it took to restore the Emacs state.  The value is an alist
<code><span class="nolinebreak">((dumped-with-pdumper</span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;t)&nbsp;<span class="nolinebreak">(load-time</span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;<var>time</var>)&nbsp;<span class="nolinebreak">(dump-file-name</span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;<var>file</var>))</code><!-- /@w -->,
where <var>file</var> is the name of the dump file, and <var>time</var> is the
time in seconds it took to restore the state from the dump file.
If the current session was not restored from a dump file, the
value is nil.
