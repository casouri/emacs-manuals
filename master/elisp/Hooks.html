<span id="Hooks-1"></span><h3 class="section">24.1 Hooks</h3>
<span id="index-hooks"></span>

<p>A <em>hook</em> is a variable where you can store a function or
functions (see <a href="What-Is-a-Function.html">What Is a Function</a>) to be called on a particular
occasion by an existing program.  Emacs provides hooks for the sake of
customization.  Most often, hooks are set up in the init file
(see <a href="Init-File.html">Init File</a>), but Lisp programs can set them also.
See <a href="Standard-Hooks.html">Standard Hooks</a>, for a list of some standard hook variables.
</p>
<span id="index-normal-hook"></span>
<p>Most of the hooks in Emacs are <em>normal hooks</em>.  These variables
contain lists of functions to be called with no arguments.  By
convention, whenever the hook name ends in &lsquo;<samp>-hook</samp>&rsquo;, that tells
you it is normal.  We try to make all hooks normal, as much as
possible, so that you can use them in a uniform way.
</p>
<p>Every major mode command is supposed to run a normal hook called the
<em>mode hook</em> as one of the last steps of initialization.  This makes
it easy for a user to customize the behavior of the mode, by overriding
the buffer-local variable assignments already made by the mode.  Most
minor mode functions also run a mode hook at the end.  But hooks are
used in other contexts too.  For example, the hook <code>suspend-hook</code>
runs just before Emacs suspends itself (see <a href="Suspending-Emacs.html">Suspending Emacs</a>).
</p>
<span id="index-abnormal-hook"></span>
<p>If the hook variable&rsquo;s name does not end with &lsquo;<samp>-hook</samp>&rsquo;, that
indicates it is probably an <em>abnormal hook</em>.  That means the hook
functions are called with arguments, or their return values are used
in some way.  The hook&rsquo;s documentation says how the functions are
called.  Any functions added to an abnormal hook must follow the
hook&rsquo;s calling convention.  By convention, abnormal hook names end in
&lsquo;<samp>-functions</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<span id="index-single_002dfunction-hook"></span>
<p>If the name of the variable ends in &lsquo;<samp>-predicate</samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp>-function</samp>&rsquo; (singular) then its value must be a function, not a
list of functions.  As with abnormal hooks, the expected arguments and
meaning of the return value vary across such <em>single function
hooks</em>.  The details are explained in each variable&rsquo;s docstring.
</p>
<p>Since hooks (both multi and single function) are variables, their
values can be modified with <code>setq</code> or temporarily with
<code>let</code>.  However, it is often useful to add or remove a particular
function from a hook while preserving any other functions it might
have.  For multi function hooks, the recommended way of doing this is
with <code>add-hook</code> and <code>remove-hook</code> (see <a href="Setting-Hooks.html">Setting Hooks</a>).
Most normal hook variables are initially void; <code>add-hook</code> knows
how to deal with this.  You can add hooks either globally or
buffer-locally with <code>add-hook</code>.  For hooks which hold only a
single function, <code>add-hook</code> is not appropriate, but you can use
<code>add-function</code> (see <a href="Advising-Functions.html">Advising Functions</a>) to combine new
functions with the hook.  Note that some single function hooks may be
<code>nil</code> which <code>add-function</code> cannot deal with, so you must
check for that before calling <code>add-function</code>.
