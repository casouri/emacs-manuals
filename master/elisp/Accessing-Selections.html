<p>The data types and selections that <code class="code">gui-get-selection</code> and
<code class="code">gui-set-selection</code> understand are not precisely specified and
differ subject to the window system on which Emacs is running.
</p>
<p>At the same time, <code class="code">gui-set-selection</code> abstracts over plenty of
complexity: its <var class="var">data</var> argument is given verbatim to
system-specific code to be rendered suitable for transfer to the
window system or requesting clients.
</p>
<p>The most comprehensive implementation of selections exists under the
X Window System.  This is both an artifact of history (X was the first
window system supported by Emacs) and one occasioned by technical
considerations: X selections are not merely an expedient for the
transfer of text and multimedia content between clients, but a general
inter-client communication system, a design that has yielded a
proliferation of selection and data types.
</p>
<p>Compounding this confusion, there is another inter-client
communication mechanism under X: the Inter-Client Exchange.  ICE is
only used by Emacs to communicate with session managers, and is a
separate topic.
