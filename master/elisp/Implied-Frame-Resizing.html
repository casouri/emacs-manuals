<p>By default, Emacs tries to keep the number of lines and columns of a
frame&rsquo;s text area (see <a class="pxref" href="Frame-Layout.html">Frame Layout</a>) unaltered when, for example,
toggling the menu or tool bar, changing the default font or setting the
default width of scroll bars on that frame.  When any of these
decorations is drawn by a toolkit, this usually means that Emacs has to
work against that toolkit because the latter usually tries to keep the
outer frame size unaltered when the size of a decoration changes, thus
implicitly changing the size of the frame&rsquo;s text area.
</p>
<p>In practice this means that whenever Emacs issues a request to add or
remove such a decoration, it will issue a second request with the
intention to restore the original size of the frame&rsquo;s text area.  When
any of these decorations is drawn by Emacs itself (like the tool bar
with the Lucid or MS-Windows builds or the tab bar), Emacs may still
have to alter the size of the native frame accordingly and issue a
resize request because these decorations should not be accounted for by
the text area of the frame.
</p>
<p>Occasionally, such <em class="dfn">implied frame resizing</em> may be unwanted, for
example, when a frame has been maximized or made full-screen (where
it&rsquo;s turned off by default).  In general, users can disable implied
resizing with the following option:
</p>
<dl class="first-defvr first-defopt-alias-first-defvr">
<dt class="defvr defopt-alias-defvr" id="index-frame_002dinhibit_002dimplied_002dresize"><span class="category-def">User Option: </span><span><strong class="def-name">frame-inhibit-implied-resize</strong><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-frame_002dinhibit_002dimplied_002dresize"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>If this option is <code class="code">nil</code>, changing a frame&rsquo;s font, menu bar, tool
bar, internal borders, fringes or scroll bars may resize its outer frame
in order to keep the number of columns or lines of its text area
unaltered.
</p>
<p>If this option is <code class="code">t</code>, Emacs will not resize a frame in any of
these cases once it has agreed with the window manager on the final
initial size of that frame.  More precisely, this means that Emacs may
resize a frame implicitly until all of its decorations have been taken
into account and it has been given the initial size requested by the
user.  Any further changes of decorations will not cause an implied
resizing of the frame.
</p>
<p>If this option equals the symbol <code class="code">force</code>, Emacs will not perform
any implied resizing of a frame even before it has agreed with the
window manager on the final initial size of that frame.  As a
consequence, the initial size of a frame&rsquo;s text area may not necessarily
reflect the one specified by the user.  This value can be useful with
tiling window managers where the initial size of a frame is determined
by external means.
</p>
<p>The value of this option can be also a list of frame parameters.  In
that case, implied resizing of a frame is inhibited for the change of
any parameters that appears in this list once Emacs has agreed with the
window manager on the final initial size of that frame.  Parameters
currently handled by this option are <code class="code">font</code>, <code class="code">font-backend</code>,
<code class="code">internal-border-width</code>, <code class="code">menu-bar-lines</code> and
<code class="code">tool-bar-lines</code>.
</p>
<p>Changing any of the <code class="code">scroll-bar-width</code>, <code class="code">scroll-bar-height</code>,
<code class="code">vertical-scroll-bars</code>, <code class="code">horizontal-scroll-bars</code>,
<code class="code">left-fringe</code> and <code class="code">right-fringe</code> frame parameters is handled
as if the frame contained just one live window.  This means, for
example, that removing vertical scroll bars on a frame containing
several side by side windows will shrink the outer frame width by the
width of one scroll bar provided this option is <code class="code">nil</code> and keep it
unchanged if this option is <code class="code">t</code> or a list containing
<code class="code">vertical-scroll-bars</code>.
</p>
<p>The default value is <code class="code">(tab-bar-lines tool-bar-lines)</code> for Lucid,
Motif and MS-Windows (which means that adding/removing a tool or tab
bar there does not change the outer frame height),
<code class="code">(tab-bar-lines)</code> on all other window systems including GTK+
(which means that changing any of the parameters listed above with the
exception of <code class="code">tab-bar-lines</code> may change the size of the outer
frame), and <code class="code">t</code> otherwise (which means the outer frame size never
changes implicitly when there&rsquo;s no window system support).
</p>
<p>Note that when a frame is not large enough to accommodate a change of
any of the parameters listed above, Emacs may try to enlarge the frame
even if this option is non-<code class="code">nil</code>.
</p>
<p>Note also that window managers usually do not ask for resizing a frame
when they change the number of lines occupied by an external menu or
tool bar.  Typically, such &ldquo;wrappings&rdquo; occur when a user shrinks a
frame horizontally, making it impossible to display all elements of its
menu or tool bar.  They may also result from a change of the major mode
altering the number of items of a menu or tool bar.  Any such wrappings
may implicitly alter the number of lines of a frame&rsquo;s text area and are
unaffected by the setting of this option.
