<p>A <em class="dfn">position</em> is the index of a character in the text of a buffer.
More precisely, a position identifies the place between two characters
(or before the first character, or after the last character), so we can
speak of the character before or after a given position.  However, we
often speak of the character &ldquo;at&rdquo; a position, meaning the character
after that position.
</p>
<p>Positions are usually represented as integers starting from 1, but
can also be represented as <em class="dfn">markers</em>&mdash;special objects that
relocate automatically when text is inserted or deleted so they stay
with the surrounding characters.  Functions that expect an argument to
be a position (an integer), but accept a marker as a substitute,
normally ignore which buffer the marker points into; they convert the
marker to an integer, and use that integer, exactly as if you had
passed the integer as the argument, even if the marker points to the
wrong buffer.  A marker that points nowhere cannot convert to an
integer; using it instead of an integer causes an error.
See <a class="xref" href="Markers.html">Markers</a>.

<p>See also the field feature (see <a class="pxref" href="Fields.html">Defining and Using Fields</a>), which provides
functions that are used by many cursor-motion commands.
