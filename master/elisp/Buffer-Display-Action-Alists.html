<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-buffer-display-action-alist"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-action-alist-for-buffer-display"></a>

<p>An <em class="dfn">action alist</em> is an association list mapping predefined
symbols recognized by action functions to values these functions are
supposed to interpret accordingly.  In each call,
<code class="code">display-buffer</code> constructs a new, possibly empty action alist
and passes that entire list on to any action function it calls.
</p>
<p>By design, action functions are free in their interpretation of
action alist entries.  In fact, some entries like
<code class="code">allow-no-window</code> or <code class="code">previous-window</code> have a meaning only
for one or a few action functions, and are ignored by the rest.  Other
entries, like <code class="code">inhibit-same-window</code> or <code class="code">window-parameters</code>,
are supposed to be respected by most action functions, including those
provided by application programs and external packages.
</p>
<p>In the previous subsection we have described in detail how
individual action functions interpret the action alist entries they
care about.  Here we give a reference list of all known action alist
entries according to their symbols, together with their values and
action functions (see <a class="pxref" href="Buffer-Display-Action-Functions.html">Action Functions for Buffer Display</a>) that
recognize them.  Throughout this list, the terms &ldquo;buffer&rdquo; will refer
to the buffer <code class="code">display-buffer</code> is supposed to display, and
&ldquo;value&rdquo; refers to the entry&rsquo;s value.
</p>
<dl class="table">

<dd><p>If the value is non-<code class="code">nil</code>, this signals that the selected window
must not be used for displaying the buffer.  All action functions that
(re-)use an existing window should respect this entry.
</p>

<dd><p>The value must specify a window that may have displayed the buffer
previously.  <code class="code">display-buffer-in-previous-window</code> will give
preference to such a window provided it is still live and not
dedicated to another buffer.
</p>
</dd>

<dd><p>The value is either a major mode or a list of major modes.
<code class="code">display-buffer-reuse-mode-window</code> may reuse a window whenever
the value specified by this entry matches the major mode of that
window&rsquo;s buffer.  Other action functions ignore such entries.
</p>
</dd>

<dd><p>The value must be a function taking one argument (a frame), supposed
to return non-<code class="code">nil</code> if that frame is a candidate for displaying
the buffer.  This entry is used by
<code class="code">display-buffer-use-some-frame</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><a id="index-reusable_002dframes_002c-a-buffer-display-action-alist-entry"></a><span><code class="code">reusable-frames</code><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-reusable_002dframes_002c-a-buffer-display-action-alist-entry"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>The value specifies the set of frames to search for a window that can
be reused because it already displays the buffer.  It can be set as
follows:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li><code class="code">nil</code> means consider only windows on the selected frame.
(Actually, the last frame used that is not a minibuffer-only frame.)
</li><li><code class="code">visible</code> means consider windows on all visible frames.
</li><li>0 means consider windows on all visible or iconified frames.
</li><li>A frame means consider windows on that frame only.
</li><li><code class="code">t</code> means consider windows on all frames.  (Note that this value
is rarely the right thing to use&mdash;it might also return a tooltip frame.)
</li></ul>

<p>Note that the meaning of <code class="code">nil</code> differs slightly from that of the
<var class="var">all-frames</var> argument to <code class="code">next-window</code> (see <a class="pxref" href="Cyclic-Window-Ordering.html">Cyclic Ordering of Windows</a>).
</p>
<p>A major client of this is <code class="code">display-buffer-reuse-window</code>, but all
other action functions that try to reuse a window are affected as
well.  <code class="code">display-buffer-in-previous-window</code> consults it when
searching for a window that previously displayed the buffer on another
frame.
</p>
<p>Action function <code class="code">display-buffer-in-tab</code> searches the tabs of the
frame(s) identified by this entry, and also interprets the value
<code class="code">nil</code> differently.
</p>

<dd><p>A non-<code class="code">nil</code> value prevents another frame from being raised or
selected, if the window chosen by <code class="code">display-buffer</code> is displayed
there.  Primarily affected by this are
<code class="code">display-buffer-use-some-frame</code> and
<code class="code">display-buffer-reuse-window</code>.  Ideally,
<code class="code">display-buffer-pop-up-frame</code> should be affected as well, but there
is no guarantee that the window manager will comply.

entry.

<dd><p>The value specifies a minimum width of the window used, in canonical
frame columns.  The special value <code class="code">full-width</code> means the chosen
window should be one that has no other windows on the left or right of
it in its frame.
</p>
<p>This entry is currently honored by <code class="code">display-buffer-use-some-window</code>
and <code class="code">display-buffer-use-least-recent-window</code>, which try hard to avoid
returning a less recently used window that does not satisfy the entry.
</p>
<p>Note that providing such an entry alone does not necessarily make the
window as wide as specified by its value.  To actually resize an
existing window or make a new window as wide as specified by this
entry&rsquo;s value, a <code class="code">window-width</code> entry specifying that value
should be provided as well.  Such a <code class="code">window-width</code> entry can,
however, specify a completely different value, or ask the window width
to fit that of its buffer, in which case the
<code class="code">window-min-width</code> entry provides the guaranteed minimum width of
the window.

<dd><p>The value specifies a minimum height of the window used, in canonical
frame lines.  The special value <code class="code">full-height</code> means the chosen
window should be a full-height window, one that has no other windows
above or below it in its frame.
</p>
<p>This entry is currently honored by <code class="code">display-buffer-below-selected</code>
which does not use a window that is not as high as specified by this
entry.  It&rsquo;s also honored by <code class="code">display-buffer-use-some-window</code> and
<code class="code">display-buffer-use-least-recent-window</code> which try hard to avoid
returning a less recently used window if it does not satisfy this
constraint.
</p>
<p>Note that providing such an entry alone does not necessarily make the
window as tall as specified by its value.  To actually resize an
existing window or make a new window as tall as specified by that
value, a <code class="code">window-height</code> entry specifying that value should be
provided as well.  Such a <code class="code">window-height</code> entry can, however,
specify a completely different value or ask the window height to be
fit to that of its buffer in which case the <code class="code">window-min-height</code>
entry provides the guaranteed minimum height of the window used.

<dd><p>The value specifies whether and how to adjust the height of the chosen
window and can be one of the following:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li><code class="code">nil</code> means to leave the height of the chosen window alone.

</li><li>An integer number specifies the desired total height of the chosen
window in lines.

desired total height with respect to the total height of its frame&rsquo;s
root window.

</li><li>A cons cell whose <small class="sc">CAR</small> is <code class="code">body-lines</code> and whose <small class="sc">CDR</small> is an
integer that specifies the height of the chosen window&rsquo;s body in frame
lines.

</li><li>If the value specifies a function, that function is called with one
argument&mdash;the chosen window.  The function is supposed to adjust the
height of the window; its return value is ignored.  Suitable functions
are <code class="code">fit-window-to-buffer</code> and
<code class="code">shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer</code>, see <a class="ref" href="Resizing-Windows.html">Resizing Windows</a>.
</li></ul>

<p>By convention, the height of the chosen window is adjusted only if the
window is part of a vertical combination (see <a class="pxref" href="Windows-and-Frames.html">Windows and Frames</a>)
to avoid changing the height of other, unrelated windows.  Also, this
entry should be processed only under certain conditions which are

<code class="code">window-size</code> is effective only to set up the size of a window
appearing alone on a frame.  The value can be one of the following:

<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li><code class="code">nil</code> means to leave the size of the chosen window alone.

</li><li>A cons cell of two integers specifies the desired total width and height
of the chosen window in lines and columns.  It&rsquo;s effect is to adjust the

<p>There is a fine difference between using this entry and using the action

necessarily have to display the buffer and the caller is prepared to

since there is no guarantee that an arbitrary caller of

will display the buffer.  <code class="code">display-buffer-no-window</code> is the only
action function that cares about this entry.

<p>By convention, the entries <code class="code">window-height</code>, <code class="code">window-width</code>
and <code class="code">preserve-size</code> are applied after the chosen window&rsquo;s buffer
has been set up and if and only if that window never showed another
buffer before.  More precisely, the latter means that the window must
have been either created by the current <code class="code">display-buffer</code> call or
the window was created earlier by <code class="code">display-buffer</code> to show the
buffer and never was used to show another buffer until it was reused
by the current invocation of <code class="code">display-buffer</code>.
</p>
<p>If no <code class="code">window-height</code>, <code class="code">window-width</code> or <code class="code">window-size</code>
entry was specified, the window may still be resized automatically when
the buffer is temporary and <code class="code">temp-buffer-resize-mode</code> has been
enabled, <a class="ref" href="Temporary-Displays.html">Temporary Displays</a>.  In that case, the <small class="sc">CDR</small> of a
<code class="code">window-height</code>, <code class="code">window-width</code> or <code class="code">window-size</code> entry
can be used to inhibit or override the default behavior of
<code class="code">temp-buffer-resize-mode</code> for specific buffers or invocations of
<code class="code">display-buffer</code>.
