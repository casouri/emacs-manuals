</dl>

<p>For decentralized version control systems (see <a class="pxref" href="VCS-Repositories.html">Decentralized vs Centralized Repositories</a>),
these commands provide specialized versions of <kbd class="kbd">C-x v M D</kbd> (see
see <a class="pxref" href="Merge-Bases.html">Merge Bases</a>) which also take into account the state of upstream
repositories.  These commands are useful both when working on a single
branch and when developing features on a separate branch
(see <a class="pxref" href="Branches.html">Version Control Branches</a>).  These two cases involve using the commands
differently, and so we will describe them separately.
</p>
<p>First, consider working on a single branch.  <em class="dfn">Outstanding changes</em>
are those which you haven&rsquo;t yet pushed upstream.  This includes both
unpushed commits and uncommitted changes in your working tree.  In many
cases the reason these changes are not pushed yet is that they are not
finished: the changes committed so far don&rsquo;t make sense in isolation.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-C_002dx-v-o-_003d"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-vc_002ddiff_002doutgoing_002dbase"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-C_002dx-v-o-D"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-vc_002droot_002ddiff_002doutgoing_002dbase"></a>
<p>Type <kbd class="kbd">C-x v o D</kbd> (<code class="code">vc-root-diff-outgoing-base</code>) to display a
summary of all these changes, committed and uncommitted.  This summary
is in the form of a diff of what committing and pushing (see <a class="pxref" href="Pulling-_002f-Pushing.html">Pulling/Pushing Changes into/from a Branch</a>) all these changes would do to the upstream repository.  You
can use <kbd class="kbd">C-x v o =</kbd> (<code class="code">vc-diff-outgoing-base</code>) instead to limit
the display of changes to the current VC fileset.  (The difference
between <kbd class="kbd">C-x&nbsp;v&nbsp;o&nbsp;D</kbd><!-- /@w --> and <kbd class="kbd">C-x&nbsp;v&nbsp;o&nbsp;=</kbd><!-- /@w --> is like the
difference between <kbd class="kbd">C-x v D</kbd> and <kbd class="kbd">C-x v =</kbd> (see <a class="pxref" href="Old-Revisions.html">Examining And Comparing Old Revisions</a>).)<a class="footnote" id="DOCF21" href="#FOOT21"><sup>21</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Second, consider developing a feature on a separate branch.  Call this
the <em class="dfn">topic branch</em>,<a class="footnote" id="DOCF22" href="#FOOT22"><sup>22</sup></a> and call the
branch from which the topic branch was originally created the
<em class="dfn">trunk</em> or <em class="dfn">development trunk</em>.
</p>
<p>In this case, outstanding changes is a more specific notion than just
unpushed and uncommitted changes on the topic branch.  You&rsquo;re not
finished sharing changes with your collaborators until they have been
merged into the trunk, and pushed.  Therefore, in this example,
outstanding changes are those which haven&rsquo;t yet been integrated into the
upstream repository&rsquo;s development trunk.  That means committed changes
on the topic branch that haven&rsquo;t yet been merged into the trunk, plus
uncommitted changes.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-outgoing-base_002c-version-control"></a>
<p>The <em class="dfn">outgoing base</em> is the upstream location for which the changes
are destined once they are no longer outstanding.  In this case, that&rsquo;s
the upstream version of the trunk, to which you and your collaborators
push finished work.
</p>
<p>To display a summary of outgoing changes in this multi-branch example,
supply a prefix argument, by typing <kbd class="kbd">C-u&nbsp;C-x&nbsp;v&nbsp;o&nbsp;=</kbd><!-- /@w --> or
<kbd class="kbd">C-u&nbsp;C-x&nbsp;v&nbsp;o&nbsp;D</kbd><!-- /@w -->.  When prompted, enter the outgoing base.
Exactly what you must supply here depends on the name of your
development trunk and the version control system in use.  For example,
with Git, usually you will enter <kbd class="kbd">origin/master</kbd>.  We hope to
improve these commands such that no prefix argument is required in the
multi-branch case, too.

<h5 class="footnote-body-heading"><a id="FOOT21" href="#DOCF21">(21)</a></h5>
<p>Another point of comparison is that these
commands are like <kbd class="kbd">C-x&nbsp;v&nbsp;O&nbsp;=</kbd><!-- /@w --> (<code class="code">vc-fileset-diff-outgoing</code>)
and <kbd class="kbd">C-x v O D</kbd> (<code class="code">vc-root-diff-outgoing</code>) except that they
include uncommitted changes in the reported diffs.  Like those other
commands, you can use a prefix argument to specify a particular upstream
location.</p>
<h5 class="footnote-body-heading"><a id="FOOT22" href="#DOCF22">(22)</a></h5>
<p>Topic branches are sometimes called
&ldquo;feature branches&rdquo;.  It is also common for the term &ldquo;feature branch&rdquo;
to be reserved for a particular kind of topic branch, one that another
branch or other branches are repeatedly merged into.</p>
