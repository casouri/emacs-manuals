<p>For decentralized version control systems (see <a class="pxref" href="VCS-Repositories.html">Decentralized vs Centralized Repositories</a>),
these commands provide ways to move the current branch back to an
earlier revision.  <code class="code">vc-delete-revisions-from-end</code> prompts for a
revision, then removes all revisions from the end of the branch up to
but not including the specified revision.  We say that the branch is
<em class="dfn">rewound</em> back to the specified revision.
</p>
<p>This command removes the changes made by the revisions from the
working tree.  Therefore, if there are any uncommitted changes, they
must be reverted, first (see <a class="pxref" href="VC-Undo.html">Undoing Version Control Actions</a>).  This command will prompt you
to do that if necessary.  If you supply a prefix argument, Emacs will
delete uncommitted changes without prompting.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-uncommitting-revisions"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-vc_002duncommit_002drevisions_002dfrom_002dend"></a>
<p>To &ldquo;uncommit&rdquo; a revision means to remove it from the revision
history without removing its changes from the working tree.  It is as
though you had made the changes but had not yet checked them in.  The
command <code class="code">vc-uncommit-revisions-from-end</code> prompts for a revision,
and then uncommits all revisions from the end of the branch up to but
not including the specified revision.  The branch is rewound back to the
specified revision but the changes are left behind in the working tree.
</p>
<p>When rewinding the current branch, if all the revisions deleted from
the revision history are among those you have pulled or pushed, then
these operations do not permanently delete anything: a simple
<kbd class="kbd">C-x&nbsp;v&nbsp;+</kbd><!-- /@w --> (see <a class="pxref" href="Pulling-_002f-Pushing.html">Pulling/Pushing Changes into/from a Branch</a>) will bring the revisions
back.  On the other hand, if there are new revisions on the end of the
branch that have not yet been pushed, then these commands will delete
them permanently.  Emacs tries to detect this situation and ask you if
you are sure you want to delete them.
</p>
<p>Alternative ways to access this functionality are the
<code class="code">log-view-uncommit-revisions-from-end</code> and
<code class="code">log-view-delete-revisions-from-end</code> commands, bound to <kbd class="kbd">x</kbd> and
<kbd class="kbd">X</kbd>, respectively, in Log View mode buffers (see <a class="pxref" href="VC-Change-Log.html">VC Change Log</a>).
Compared to using the commands described here directly, the Log View
mode commands can make it easier to be sure you are rewinding back to
the revision you intend.
