<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-touchscreen-input"></a>

<p>Touchscreen input is the manipulation of a frame&rsquo;s contents by the
placement and motion of tools (instanced by fingers and such pointing
devices as styluses) on a monitor or computer terminal where it is
displayed.
</p>
<p>Two factors, the order and position on which such tools are placed,
are compared against predefined patterns dubbed <em class="dfn">gestures</em>, after
which any gesture those factors align with designates a series of
actions to be taken on the text beneath the tools; the gestures
presently recognized are:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-tapping_002c-touchscreens"></a>
<em class="dfn">Tapping</em>, briefly placing and lifting a tool from the display,
will select the window that was tapped, and execute any command bound
to <code class="code">mouse-1</code> at that location in the window.  If a link
(see <a class="pxref" href="Mouse-References.html">Following References with the Mouse</a>) exists there, then Emacs will follow that
link instead (insofar as such action differs from that taken upon the
simulation of a <code class="code">mouse-1</code> event).

</li><li><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-scrolling_002c-touchscreens"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-touch_002dscreen_002denable_002dhscroll"></a>
<em class="dfn">Scrolling</em>, which is continuous vertical or horizontal motion
on the screen, will scroll the contents of the window beneath the
tool&rsquo;s initial location in the direction of movement.  The user option
<code class="code">touch-screen-enable-hscroll</code> governs whether horizontal
scrolling (see <a class="pxref" href="Horizontal-Scrolling.html">Horizontal Scrolling</a>) is performed in reaction to
this gesture.

</li><li><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-dragging_002c-touchscreens"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-long_002dpress_002c-touchscreens"></a>
<em class="dfn">Dragging</em>, which is performing a <em class="dfn">long-press</em> by placing a
tool on the display and leaving it there awhile before moving it to
another position, will move point to the tool&rsquo;s initial position, and
commence selecting text under the tool as it continues its motion, as
if <code class="code">mouse-1</code> were to be held down and a mouse moved analogously.
See <a class="xref" href="Mouse-Commands.html">Mouse Commands for Editing</a>.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-touch_002dscreen_002dword_002dselect"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-word-selection-mode_002c-touchscreens"></a>
<p>To the detriment of text selection, it can prove challenging to
position a tool accurately on a touch screen display.  The user option
<code class="code">touch-screen-word-select</code>, which when enabled, prompts dragging
to select the complete word under the tool.  (Normally, the selection
is only extended to encompass the character beneath the tool.)
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-touch_002dscreen_002dextend_002dselection"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-extending-the-selection_002c-touchscreens"></a>
<p>In the same vein, it may be difficult to select all of the text
intended within a single gesture.  If the user option
<code class="code">touch-screen-extend-selection</code> is enabled, taps on the locations
of the point or the mark within a window will begin a new &ldquo;drag&rdquo;
gesture, where the region will be extended in the direction of any
subsequent movement.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-touch_002dscreen_002dpreview_002dselect"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-previewing-the-region-during-selection_002c-touchscreens"></a>
<p>Difficulties in making accurate adjustments to the region from the
cursor being physically obscured by the tool can be mitigated by
indicating the position of the point within the echo area.  If
<code class="code">touch-screen-preview-select</code> is non-<code class="code">nil</code>, the line
surrounding point is displayed in the echo area (see <a class="pxref" href="Echo-Area.html">The Echo Area</a>)
during the motion of the tool, below which is another line indicating
the position of point relative to the first.
</p>
</li><li><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-pinching_002c-touchscreens"></a>
<em class="dfn">Pinching</em>, the placement of two tools apart on the screen
followed by adjustments to their position such as to increase or
decrease the distance between them will modify the text scale
(see <a class="pxref" href="Text-Scale.html">Text Scale</a>) in proportion to the change in that distance.
</li></ul>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-touch_002dscreen_002ddelay"></a>
<p>Emacs registers a long-press after the time a tool has been placed
upon the screen exceeds 0.7 seconds.  This delay can be adjusted
through customizing the variable <code class="code">touch-screen-delay</code>.
