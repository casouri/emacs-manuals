<p>Android is an operating system for mobile devices developed by the
Open Handset Alliance, a group of companies interested in developing
handsets that can run a common set of software.  It is supposedly free
software.
</p>
<p>Like the X Consortium of times past, the Open Handset Alliance
believes that &ldquo;openness&rdquo; (namely, the regular release of the Android
source code) is simply a tool to increase the popularity of the
Android platform.  Computer companies normally produce proprietary
software.  The companies in the Open Handset Alliance are no different
&ndash; most versions of Android installed on devices are proprietary, by
virtue of containing proprietary components, that often cannot even be
replaced by the user.
</p>
<p>Android is not designed to respect users&rsquo; freedom.  Almost all
versions of Android (including some which are supposedly free
software) include support for Digital Restrictions Management,
technology that is designed to limit users&rsquo; ability to copy media to
and from their own devices.  Most Android devices also come with
proprietary Google applications which are required to run the system,
and many other Android applications.
</p>
<p>Thus, it must be necessary to consider Android proprietary software
from a practical standpoint.  That is an injustice.  If you use
Android, we urge you to switch to a free operating system, if only for
your freedom&rsquo;s sake.
</p>
<p>We support GNU Emacs on proprietary operating systems because we
hope this taste of freedom will inspire users to escape from them.
