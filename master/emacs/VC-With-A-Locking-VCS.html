<span id="Basic-Version-Control-with-Locking"></span><h4 class="subsubsection">28.1.3.2 Basic Version Control with Locking</h4>

<p>On a locking-based version control system (such as SCCS, and RCS in
its default mode), <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> does the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li> If there is more than one file in the VC fileset and the files have
inconsistent version control statuses, signal an error.

</li><li> If each file in the VC fileset is not registered with a version
control system, register the VC fileset.  See <a href="Registering.html">Registering</a>.  If
Emacs cannot find a system to register under, it prompts for a
repository type, creates a new repository, and registers the VC
fileset with it.

</li><li> If each file is registered and unlocked, lock it and make it writable,
so that you can begin to edit it.

</li><li> If each file is locked by you and contains changes, commit the
changes.  To do this, Emacs pops up a <samp>*vc-log*</samp> buffer; type the
desired log entry for the new revision, followed by <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> to
commit (see <a href="Log-Buffer.html">Log Buffer</a>).

</li><li> If each file is locked by you, but you have not changed it, release
the lock and make the file read-only again.

</li><li> If each file is locked by another user, ask whether you want to
steal the lock.  If you say yes, the file becomes locked by you,
and a warning message is sent to the user who had formerly locked the
file.
</li></ul>

<p>These rules also apply when you use CVS in locking mode, except
that CVS does not support stealing locks.
