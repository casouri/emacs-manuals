<p>The <em class="dfn">merge base</em> of two branches is the most recent revision that
exists on both branches.  If neither of the branches was ever merged
into the other (see <a class="pxref" href="Merging.html">Merging Branches</a>), then the merge base is the revision
that the older of the two branches was at when the newer branch was
created from it (see <a class="pxref" href="Creating-Branches.html">Creating New Branches</a>).  If one of the branches was
ever merged into the other, then the merge base is the most recent merge
point.
</p>
<p>The commands described in this section are currently implemented only
for decentralized version control systems (see <a class="pxref" href="VCS-Repositories.html">Decentralized vs Centralized Repositories</a>).

<p>Merge bases are useful to make certain comparisons between branches, and
Emacs provides two commands for doing so.  Each of <kbd class="kbd">C-x v M D</kbd>
(<code class="code">vc-diff-mergebase</code>) and <kbd class="kbd">C-x v M L</kbd> (<code class="code">vc-log-mergebase</code>)
prompts for two branches, finds their merge base, and then compares that
merge base with the second of the two branches.  The commands report
diffs and display change history, respectively.
</p>
<p>The typical use case for these commands is when one of the branches was
originally created from the other and you or a collaborator have made
merges of one of the branches into the other at least once.  Then you
can use these commands to see what changes on one branch have not yet
been merged into the other.
</p>
<p>Call the branch which has the changes you are interested in the &ldquo;source
branch&rdquo; and the branch into which these changes have not yet been
merged the &ldquo;target branch&rdquo;.  Specify the target branch when prompted
for the &ldquo;older revision&rdquo; and the source branch when prompted for the
&ldquo;newer revision&rdquo;.<a class="footnote" id="DOCF20" href="#FOOT20"><sup>20</sup></a>  Then <kbd class="kbd">C-x v M D</kbd> shows you a preview of what would change
on the target branch if you were to merge the source branch into it, and
<kbd class="kbd">C-x v M L</kbd> shows you a log of the changes on the source branch not
yet merged into the target branch.

<p>The concept of merge bases generalizes from
branches to any two revisions.  The merge base of two revisions is the
most recent revision that can be found in the revision history of both
of the two revisions.  <kbd class="kbd">C-x v M D</kbd> and <kbd class="kbd">C-x v M L</kbd> accept any
two revisions, not just branches.  Comparing two branches is the same as
comparing the revisions at the ends of the branches.
</p>
<p>(In fact the concept generalizes to any number of revisions, but Emacs&rsquo;s
commands for merge bases work with only two, so we limit ourselves to
that.)</p>
