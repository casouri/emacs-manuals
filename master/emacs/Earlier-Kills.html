<span id="Yanking-Earlier-Kills"></span><h4 class="subsection">12.2.2 Yanking Earlier Kills</h4>
<span id="index-yanking-previous-kills"></span>

<p>As explained in <a href="Yanking.html">Yanking</a>, you can use a numeric argument to
<kbd>C-y</kbd> to yank text that is no longer the most recent kill.  This
is useful if you remember which kill ring entry you want.  If you
don&rsquo;t, you can use the <kbd>M-y</kbd> (<code>yank-pop</code>) command to cycle
through the possibilities or to select one of the earlier kills.
</p>
<span id="index-M_002dy"></span>
<span id="index-yank_002dpop"></span>
<p>If the previous command was a yank command, <kbd>M-y</kbd> takes the text
that was yanked and replaces it with the text from an earlier kill.
So, to recover the text of the next-to-the-last kill, first use
<kbd>C-y</kbd> to yank the last kill, and then use <kbd>M-y</kbd> to replace it
with the previous kill.  This works only after a <kbd>C-y</kbd>
or another <kbd>M-y</kbd>.  (If <kbd>M-y</kbd> is invoked after some other
command, it works differently, see below.)
</p>
<p>You can understand this operation mode of <kbd>M-y</kbd> in terms of a
last-yank pointer which points at an entry in the kill ring.  Each
time you kill, the last-yank pointer moves to the newly made entry at
the front of the ring.  <kbd>C-y</kbd> yanks the entry which the last-yank
pointer points to.  <kbd>M-y</kbd> after a <kbd>C-y</kbd> or another <kbd>M-y</kbd>
moves the last-yank pointer to the previous entry, and the text in the
buffer changes to match.  Enough <kbd>M-y</kbd> commands one after another
can move the pointer to any entry in the ring, so you can get any
entry into the buffer.  Eventually the pointer reaches the end of the
ring; the next <kbd>M-y</kbd> loops back around to the first entry again.
</p>
<p><kbd>M-y</kbd> moves the last-yank pointer around the ring, but it does
not change the order of the entries in the ring, which always runs from
the most recent kill at the front to the oldest one still remembered.
</p>
<p>When used after <kbd>C-y</kbd> or <kbd>M-y</kbd>, <kbd>M-y</kbd> can take a numeric
argument, which tells it how many entries to advance the last-yank
pointer by.  A negative argument moves the pointer toward the front of
the ring; from the front of the ring, it moves around to the last
entry and continues forward from there.
</p>
<p>Once the text you are looking for is brought into the buffer, you
can stop doing <kbd>M-y</kbd> commands and the last yanked text will stay
there.  It&rsquo;s just a copy of the kill ring entry, so editing it in the
buffer does not change what&rsquo;s in the ring.  As long as no new killing
is done, the last-yank pointer remains at the same place in the kill
ring, so repeating <kbd>C-y</kbd> will yank another copy of the same
previous kill.
</p>
<p>When you call <kbd>C-y</kbd> with a numeric argument, that also sets the
last-yank pointer to the entry that it yanks.
</p>
<p>You can also invoke <kbd>M-y</kbd> after a command that is not a yank
command.  In that case, <kbd>M-y</kbd> prompts you in the minibuffer for
one of the previous kills.  You can use the minibuffer history
commands (see <a href="Minibuffer-History.html">Minibuffer History</a>) to navigate or search through
the entries in the kill ring until you find the one you want to
reinsert.  Or you can use completion commands (see <a href="Completion-Commands.html">Completion Commands</a>) to complete on an entry from the list of entries in the
kill ring or pop up the <samp>*Completions*</samp> buffer with the candidate
entries from which you can choose.  After selecting the kill-ring
entry, you can optionally edit it in the minibuffer.  Finally, type
<kbd>RET</kbd> to exit the minibuffer and insert the text of the selected
kill-ring entry.  Like in case of <kbd>M-y</kbd> after another yank
command, the last-yank pointer is left pointing at the text you just
yanked, whether it is one of the previous kills or an entry from the
kill-ring that you edited before inserting it.  (In the latter case,
the edited entry is added to the front of the kill-ring.)  So here,
too, typing <kbd>C-y</kbd> will yank another copy of the text just
inserted.
</p>
<p>When invoked with a plain prefix argument (<kbd>C-u M-y</kbd>) after a
command that is not a yank command, <kbd>M-y</kbd> leaves the cursor in
front of the inserted text, and sets the mark at the end, like
<kbd>C-y</kbd> does.
