<p>The cursor in the selected window shows the location where most
editing commands take effect, which is called <em class="dfn">point</em><a class="footnote" id="DOCF2" href="#FOOT2"><sup>2</sup></a>.  Many Emacs commands move point
to different places in the buffer; for example, you can place point by
clicking mouse button 1 (normally the left button) at the desired
location.
</p>
<p>By default, the cursor in the selected window is drawn as a solid
block and appears to be <em class="emph">on</em> a character, but you should think of
point as <em class="emph">between</em> two characters; it is situated <em class="emph">before</em>
the character under the cursor.  For example, if your text looks like
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">frob</samp>&rsquo; with the cursor over the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">b</samp>&rsquo;, then point is between
the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">o</samp>&rsquo; and the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">b</samp>&rsquo;.  If you insert the character &lsquo;<samp class="samp">!</samp>&rsquo;
at that position, the result is &lsquo;<samp class="samp">fro!b</samp>&rsquo;, with point between the
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">!</samp>&rsquo;  and the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">b</samp>&rsquo;.  Thus, the cursor remains over the
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">b</samp>&rsquo;, as before.
</p>
<p>If you are editing several files in Emacs, each in its own buffer,
each buffer has its own value of point.  A buffer that is not
currently displayed remembers its value of point if you later display
it again.  Furthermore, if a buffer is displayed in multiple windows,
each of those windows has its own value of point.
</p>
<p>See <a class="xref" href="Cursor-Display.html">Displaying the Cursor</a>, for options that control how Emacs displays
the cursor.

<p>The
term &ldquo;point&rdquo; comes from the character &lsquo;<samp class="samp">.</samp>&rsquo;, which was the
command in TECO (the language in which the original Emacs was written)
for accessing the editing position.</p>
