<h2 class="appendix" id="Emacs-28-Antinews"><span>Appendix A Emacs 28 Antinews<a class="copiable-link" href="#Emacs-28-Antinews"> &para;</a></span></h2>

<p>For those users who live backwards in time, here is information about
downgrading to Emacs version 28.2.  We hope you will enjoy the greater
simplicity that results from the absence of many Emacs&nbsp;29.2<!-- /@w --> features.
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>The implementation of overlays is back to its simple, time-proven
storage in a pair of linear linked lists centered around some buffer
position.  No more fancy interval trees and suchlikes.  Lisp programs
that use overlays once again need to recenter overlays around the
buffer position of interest, and display-related features should again
make sure they don&rsquo;t use too many overlays in a buffer, lest redisplay
will be too slow.

</li><li>Several functions stopped the annoying conversion of quotes and key
sequences by no longer calling <code class="code">substitute-command-keys</code>.  One
prominent example is <code class="code">format-prompt</code> and all its many callers.
This makes the strings they produce much more predictable, returning
to you, the Lisp programmer, control on which punctuation characters
will appear in the text presented to the users.  For similar reasons,
the <code class="code">substitute-quotes</code> function was deleted.

</li><li>The venerable <code class="code">buffer-modified-p</code> function again reliably returns
either <code class="code">nil</code> or <code class="code">t</code>, not any other confusing values.

</li><li>The support for &lsquo;<samp class="samp">medium</samp>&rsquo; weight of fonts was dropped.  Emacs now
considers &lsquo;<samp class="samp">medium</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">regular</samp>&rsquo; weights to be the same.  We
believe this will simplify your font setup, since there&rsquo;s no longer a
need to worry about fonts that support &lsquo;<samp class="samp">regular</samp>&rsquo; weight, but not
the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">medium</samp>&rsquo; one, or vice versa: either one will do!

</li><li>To reduce the amount of code in Emacs related to unimportant features,
we&rsquo;ve removed the function <code class="code">compiled-function-p</code>.  Lisp programs
are expected to test explicitly for the relevant types of function
objects: built-in, byte-compiled, and natively-compiled.  For the same
reasons we deleted the functions <code class="code">pos-bol</code>, <code class="code">pos-eol</code>,
<code class="code">file-attribute-file-identifier</code>, and quite a few others.  We
don&rsquo;t expect anyone to miss those fancy functions.

</li><li>The timeout used by <code class="code">x-show-tip</code> can no longer be specified by
Lisp programs; it is hard-coded in the function.  This will lead to a
simpler, easier maintained code, and no one should want to control the
timeout after which the tip pops down.

</li><li>The macro <code class="code">setopt</code> was deleted; use <code class="code">customize-variable</code>
instead, or invoke the <code class="code">:set</code> function from Lisp.

</li><li>We removed the <code class="code">lisp-directory</code> variable, as the value can be
easily deduced from other similar variables, like
<code class="code">installation-directory</code> and <code class="code">source-directory</code>, each one
when it&rsquo;s relevant.

</li><li>To simplify code and reduce complexity, we deleted the functions
<code class="code">get-display-property</code> and <code class="code">add-display-text-property</code>; use
the generic <code class="code">get-text-property</code> and <code class="code">put-text-property</code>
instead.

</li><li>Support for pinch input events and for modern drag-and-drop
functionality on X was dropped.  As you move back in time, these
facilities will become less and less important, and will soon enough
disappear, so there&rsquo;s no reason to keep them in Emacs.

</li><li>To keep Emacs clean and elegant, we&rsquo;ve removed the <samp class="file">textsec.el</samp>
library, with its facilities for checking whether some text is
&ldquo;suspicious&rdquo;.  We consider our users smart enough to detect
maliciously modified text by just looking at it or by moving the
cursor across it, and the whole idea that someone would wish to
deliberately deceive Emacs users ridiculous and unworthy of
complicating our elegant text-processing and display capabilities.

</li><li>The functions <code class="code">keymap-set</code>, <code class="code">keymap-global-set</code>,
<code class="code">keymap-local-set</code>, <code class="code">keymap-substitute</code>,
<code class="code">keymap-lookup</code>, and some others were deleted.  We have found the
traditional <code class="code">define-key</code>, <code class="code">global-set-key</code>,
<code class="code">local-set-key</code>, <code class="code">substitute-key-definition</code>, and
<code class="code">key-binding</code> more than enough, and their minor inconsistencies
in the syntax of keys they accept a source of endless fun in Emacs
Lisp programming.  Why make Emacs programming a dull place?  For the
same reasons we deleted <code class="code">key-valid-p</code>, since we consider the
permissive nature of <code class="code">kbd</code> more in the spirit of Emacs Lisp.

</li><li>Yanking of anything but plain text from other applications becomes
more and more an unnecessary feature as you move back in time, so we
dropped support for pasting media like HTML and images via the
clipboard.  If you <i class="i">really</i> need to yank those into an Emacs buffer,
you can go via a disk file.

</li><li>We removed unnecessary functions <code class="code">string-pixel-width</code> and
<code class="code">string-glyph-split</code>, as we consider it inappropriate for Lisp
programs to do display layout calculations, where these functions come
in handy.  Display is for the display engine, written in C, and should
stay there!

</li><li>Various new Xwidget functions, such as
<code class="code">xwidget-perform-lispy-event</code>, <code class="code">xwidget-webkit-load-html</code>,
and <code class="code">xwidget-webkit-back-forward-list</code>, were deleted as part of
our continuing effort to gradually delete the entire Xwidget
functionality in some previous release of Emacs.

</li><li>Setting the <code class="code">:stderr</code> property of a process in a
<code class="code">make-process</code> call once again forces the process&rsquo;s connection to
use pipes, not ptys, for all the standard streams &mdash; a considerable
simplification of this complex interface.

</li><li>To keep the amount of Lisp functions from growing out of control, we
deleted <code class="code">string-equal-ignore-case</code>.  Use <code class="code">compare-strings</code>
instead.

<p>Several features that complicated the byte compiler have been removed:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-minus">
<li>The warnings about quoting mistakes in documentation strings.  You are
expected to find such mistakes yourself, by eyeballing the resulting
<samp class="file">*Help*</samp> buffer display.

</li><li>The warnings about malformed <code class="code">defcustom</code> types, like
double-quoting symbols in <code class="code">choice</code> lists.
</li></ul>

</li><li>The macro <code class="code">with-buffer-unmodified-if-unchanged</code> was deleted.
Lisp programs that need to leave the buffer unmodified in these cases
can always compare the text before and after the modifications.

</li><li>The functions <code class="code">string-edit</code> and <code class="code">read-string-from-buffer</code>
were removed, as we consider the fun of programming them anew every
time an important part of the education of each Emacs Lisp developer.

</li><li>We deleted the function <code class="code">readablep</code> and the related variable
<code class="code">print-unreadable-function</code>, since no one is supposed to want to
print unreadable Lisp objects.

</li><li>The facility for storing multisession variables was deleted as an
unnecessary complication.  With it are gone <code class="code">multisession-value</code>,
<code class="code">define-multisession-variable</code>, and
<code class="code">list-multisession-values</code>.

</li><li>The support for the <code class="code">cursor-face</code> text property was dropped.  We
consider the rest of the faces adequate for supporting this
functionality.

</li><li>The function <code class="code">tooltip-show</code> dropped support for optional face
arguments <code class="code">text-face</code> and <code class="code">default-face</code> that allow fancy
control of the face of the tip text and top frame colors.  We decided
that tooltips should all look the same, to prevent user confusion.

</li><li>As part of the ongoing quest for simplicity, many other functions and
variables have been eliminated.  Other functions and variables, that
were declared obsolete since Emacs 24, have been added back, in
preparation for releasing Emacs 24 in some distant past.
