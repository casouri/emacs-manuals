<p>Some window systems provide support for input devices that react to
the user&rsquo;s touching the screen and moving fingers while touching the
screen.  These input devices are known as touchscreens, and Emacs
reports the events they generate as <em class="dfn">touchscreen events</em>.
</p>
<p>Most individual events generated by a touchscreen only have meaning as
part of a larger sequence of other events: for instance, the simple
operation of tapping the touchscreen involves the user placing and
raising a finger on the touchscreen, and swiping the display to
scroll it involves placing a finger, moving it many times upwards or
downwards, and then raising the finger.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-touch-point_002c-in-touchscreen-events"></a>
<p>While a simplistic model consisting of one finger is adequate for taps
and scrolling, more complicated gestures require support for keeping
track of multiple fingers, where the position of each finger is
represented by a <em class="dfn">touch point</em>.  For example, a &ldquo;pinch to zoom&rdquo;
gesture might consist of the user placing two fingers and moving them
individually in opposite directions, where the distance between the
positions of their individual points determine the amount by which to
zoom the display, and the center of an imaginary line between those
positions determines where to pan the display after zooming.
</p>
<p>The low-level touchscreen events described below can be used to
implement all the touch sequences described above.  In those events,
each point is represented by a cons of an arbitrary number identifying
the point and a mouse position list (see <a class="pxref" href="Click-Events.html">Click Events</a>) specifying
the position of the finger when the event occurred.

position.  <var class="var">points</var> is a list of touch points containing the
up-to-date positions of each touch point currently on the touchscreen.

display, because another program took the grab, or because the user
raised the finger from the touchscreen.
